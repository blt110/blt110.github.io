          <h5 id="what-childcare-experience-do-you-have">What childcare experience do you have?</h5>
<p>I have been an in-home childcare provider since 2013. Prior to that, I was a classroom aide for five summers, and during those school years I ran practicum sessions as a student music therapist, including in schools. Throughout my teenage years, I was occasionally a referee for the youngest soccer leagues, a junior camp counselor at a boy scout day camp, a tutor, or a babysitter.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-important-to-you-in-finding-a-family">What is important to you in finding a family?</h5>
<p>Mutual respect for every person in the relationship is extremely important to me. I also look for open, comfortable communication and safety as a priority.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-availability">What is your availability?</h5>
<p>I am currently open to mornings-only or full time arrangements.</p>
<h5 id="what-was-your-childhood-like">What was your childhood like?</h5>
<p>Busy! My parents supported and encouraged my younger siblings and I through an ever-expanding list of activities and interests, from music, swim, and gymnastics lessons to graciously thanking me for the 547th keychain I&rsquo;d braided.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-work-in-a-home-with-pets">Can you work in a home with pets?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! I have no pet allergies and love being around animals. If you have pets in your home I&rsquo;ll of course have some questions for you - and I reserve the right to draw the line at snakes and spiders!</p>
<h5 id="do-you-drive">Do you drive?</h5>
<p>I am a safe and cautious driver, and have a perfect driving record. I do require that a vehicle is provided by the family for transportation during work.</p>
<h5 id="are-you-first-aid-trained">Are you first aid trained?</h5>
<p>Yes! I keep my certification current, taking an in-person first aid/CPR class every two years. I have also had lifeguard and winderness first aid training.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-cook">Can you cook?</h5>
<p>I like to think so! I&rsquo;ll never claim to be a chef, but I have a growing collection of tried-and-true recipes that I use both at work and in my home life. I cook primarily &ldquo;from scratch,&rdquo; avoiding canned soups and frozen dinners. I love to involve children in the kitchen with age-appropriate tasks!</p>
<h5 id="can-you-swim">Can you swim?</h5>
<p>I am a strong swimmer, and confident caring for children at both pool and beach settings. I have taken lifeguard training through Red Cross, though my certification has lapsed.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-have-experience-with-children-with-special-needs">Do you have experience with children with special needs?</h5>
<p>For five summers during university, I worked as a classroom aide in a school for children with developmental disabilities. Particularly, I was placed in a classroom of non-ambulatory children, from ages three up to early teens. Most of these children were also non-verbal, and any activity we did required significant adaptation between the students to ensure they each gained something from the experience. As I was studying music therapy at the time, I also arranged with the school to provide occasional music experience sessions to other classrooms in the building. As a music therapy student, I worked under instruction of board certified music therapists to create and implement music sessions with different populations, including several groups of children with both developmental disabilities and behavioral disorders.</p>
<h5 id="how-else-can-you-help-my-family">How else can you help my family?</h5>
<p>I am first and foremost a childcare provider. However, I can help out your family in other ways when I am not directly responsible for taking care of children - during naptime, or during school hours for older children. I have great organizational skills, am willing to do a bit of light cleaning, especially when it&rsquo;s child-related, and enjoy cooking. If you are looking for more than straight childcare, we can absolutely talk about how I can best assist your family!</p>
