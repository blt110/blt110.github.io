[{"categories":null,"contents":"For the last three days of spring break, the older two kiddos went away for a few days. G3 and I got to hang out and do everything by her schedule, which was really cool! We had a variety of springtime and Easter activities to keep us busy.\nOn day 1, we started things off by making our own little flower garden out of popsicle sticks and cupcake wrappers. It was, of course, completely intentional to have a \u0026ldquo;container\u0026rdquo; as the flower, because once they dried, we used them as the base for a counting, adding, and subtracting activity with little yellow pom poms for pollen. I put a number in each flower and dumped a few pom poms in, and then G3 used tweezers (which she soon got tired of and switched to her fingers) to make sure the right number of pollen was inside each flower.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I also put some of our letters inside Easter eggs and hid them around the room. After she found them, she identified the letter and matched it to the right place on the alphabet placemat.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Finally, she made a jumping rabbit out of a paper cup. She decorated the outside (I helped her with the mouth but the rest was all G3!) and then I put a rubber band underneath. When you stack it on top of another cup, the rubber band launched it up into the air.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  On day 2, we started by doing a science experiment on chromatography. We colored a dark line of marker on a coffee filter, and then put it in a small jar of water. As the water seeps through the filter, it drags the marker along with it and, if you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, gives you a bit of a rainbow of colors! Black worked the best for us. Others were still fun to watch spread across the papers and make patterns based on how the line was drawn or the paper was folded. Later in the day after they\u0026rsquo;d dried, we turned them into butterflies.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  We also started working on our foil Easter eggs. We used hot glue to create a pattern on cardboard, then covered it with foil, and (while heavily supervised!) used sharpies to add color to the foil. I made one alongside G3, and I think if she did it again she would add a lot more hot glue to create the relief patterns as she only had a couple drops on there.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  On day 3, we started by finishing up our foil eggs. We also made rabbits out of our handprints - probably won\u0026rsquo;t do that activity again (maybe with older kids? I had to do a lot of it for G3, which kinda defeats the purpose of having activities geared toward her strengths and needs, but overall it wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly exciting).\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Finally, we wrapped up our springtime and Easter week with paintings of cherry blossoms, which are in full bloom around here right now! We used watercolor for the trunks, globbing a whole heap of it onto the paper and using a straw to blow it across the page and create branches. Once that dried, we used a q-tip to add our blossoms.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/springtime-and-easter/","tags":null,"title":"Springtime/Easter Week"},{"categories":null,"contents":"G6 has made a request for more theme weeks, and we kicked off the new run of them with Saint Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day! Feels like we are picking up where we left off as early last year is when I originally started theme weeks, and Saint Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day week was the first week of shelter-in-place due to COVID-19, when I was not going in to work.\nOn Monday, we started our rainbow twirlers. We traced a large plate to get our circle shapes, and then I gave them paint one color at a time in hopes that G3 would get more separated colors than mixing mud, which was partially successful but not completely. Of course, I do love her creation as it is, too!\nWe let them dry overnight, and then on Tuesday, we cut out the circles, made it into a spiral, and attached to a chopstick. B7 decided to keep his as a circle and was really enjoying seeing if it would make a good frisbee, which it surprisingly did to some degree!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  We had a few minutes free later in the day on Monday, but not quite enough to finish up the rainbow twirlers. Instead, I gave them each three green pipe cleaners, and went through how to make a shamrock ring step by step (G3 could do a fair bit of it, but did need some assistance with the trickier steps.) This time, I decided not to tell them what we were making. The final version needs a tiny bit of rearranging to make it all sit the right way, and it was like a big reveal of a magic trick when everything finally lined up and they could see what it was. B7 thought it was the coolest thing!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  On Tuesday I also gave the older kids this mix-up of letters as a riddle. G6 caught on after a couple minutes that the colors could be sorted to spell each of the colors in the rainbow and made quick work of sorting it all out!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  On Wednesday - Saint Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day itself - we did some green food tasting for snack. I had them close their eyes and put a bit of each food on a spoon for them, and they wrote down what they thought it was. G3 was feeling a little nervous about doing it \u0026ldquo;blind,\u0026rdquo; so I put hers in a bowl instead. The older two both did pretty well! The green bean was the stumper of the day though (probably because they usually have them stir-fried, not raw!)\nOn Thursday, G3 and I got to hang out all morning, just us! We went out for a scooter ride around the neighborhood to beat the rain, and as we were on our way back, she asked me when she was going to get another \u0026ldquo;camp day\u0026rdquo; like her flower day and snow day. Since I had a few more ideas mulling around for Saint Patrick\u0026rsquo;s, I said \u0026ldquo;why, today, of course, as soon as we get home!\u0026rdquo; and put my thinking cap on to make sure I could modify remaining activities to be catered right to her interests.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I started off by bringing out the colored letters again. I asked her to sort them by color, and then we sounded out the rainbow color words and unscrambled the letters.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Next, we used a heart to trace a shamrock onto paper, which she decorated free-form (this picture is from when I mistakenly thought she was done\u0026hellip; I was wrong, it was just intermission!) I held the heart in place while she traced, and then we decided together which lines to trace with marker to give her a good outline.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Finally, we made her leprechaun-spotting telescope. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how this one would go over given that St. Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day was the day before and the \u0026ldquo;lore\u0026rdquo; surrounding it these days seems to be that leprechauns are out the night before to make mischief before they \u0026ldquo;go back to Ireland,\u0026rdquo; but she had LOADS of fun \u0026ldquo;spotting\u0026rdquo; leprechauns on the roof, in the flower garden, in the grass, and even in my hair! When G6 came home from kindergarten, she made her own leprechaun-spotting binoculars and joined in the fun. I had them decorate the outer covering as flat paper while I added some \u0026ldquo;Saint Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day magic\u0026rdquo; to the ends of the tubes (cut out shamrock shapes). We let the glitter glue dry overnight and I assembled them Friday morning, but they had a day\u0026rsquo;s play with them without their decorations even applied.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/saint-patricks-day/","tags":null,"title":"Saint Patrick's Day"},{"categories":null,"contents":"For ski week, I asked each of the kids what they most hoped to do in that week. B7 asked to go for a hike. G6 asked to make oobleck. And G3 asked for \u0026ldquo;space camp\u0026rdquo; - a girl after my own heart!\nSince I had a few odds and ends to do around the house this afternoon (folding a load of laundry, prepping dinner, etc.) I set up this \u0026ldquo;camp\u0026rdquo; day with stations-style activities rather than everyone doing the same activities in a certain order at the same time. This also allowed for a slightly different style of activity that I only had one copy of, as they could each participate at different times without just waiting.\nStation #1 was the constellation geoboard. I drew out patterns of several commonly seen or referenced constellations. I filled half the cork board with (relatively) evenly spaced pins, and left the other blank, to give them the option to go with creating their own. I gave them loom bands to use to connect the pins together.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Station #2 was an invitation to create their own galaxy drawing with chalk pastels. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve given them chalk pastels to explore before, so I was excited about this one. We briefly talked about how there were all different shapes of galaxies in my little introduction, and I showed them some images of different types of galaxies.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  For station #3, I created a box with glove inserts, and inside, put a variety of tools and itema to manipulate. I beleive I had a couple cups (one full of rice), rocks of a few different sizes, a magnifying glass, spoon, tweezers\u0026hellip; I think that was it.\nLearn from my mistakes! I still strongly believe that this is a fabulous activity, but the execution needs considerable refinement.\n  • Know thine children. I know my 3 don\u0026rsquo;t really do completely open-ended exploration. They thrive off having tasks to complete. And yet, I still gave them this open-ended activity, hoping that the novelty was enough to inspire some ideas. Spoiler alert - it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. They might experiment and change things up in the process of completing those tasks, but this needed to be much more structured to begin with. Next time, I will include a list of actions - \u0026ldquo;move rice from one cup to another using a spoon\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Observe three rocks with a magnifying glass - what do you see that is unique about them?\u0026rdquo; and so on.\n  • Kid. Sized. Gloves. I have no idea if they exist - I have seen kids disposable latex type gloves, but you really need the length up the arm that you get from dishwashing gloves for extra mobility inside the box. That being said, I would absolutely trade the glove length for something that fit their hand more closely.\n  • Experiment with different ways to fasten the gloves to the holes in the box, and make sure they stay put. You want some heavy-duty tape here. Masking tape won\u0026rsquo;t work. Packing tape won\u0026rsquo;t work. I had no other options. We eventually just took the tape off and let them move more freely - it was way easier than fussing with the attachment points.\n  • Did you know there is cling wrap that isn\u0026rsquo;t completely transparent? I did not know this. When I checked the cabinet at work I only looked for a box. Saw the word \u0026ldquo;saran\u0026rdquo; and moved on with my life. Oops. Had a bit of a shock when I went to cover the box while setting up!\n     View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Station #4 was all about docking at the ISS. They have seen the Dragon docking and undocking, and we reviewed how it works. Each of them made a little spaceship out of lego. We then tied a string around the spacecraft, and tied the other end around their head. The goal was to get the spacecraft to dock cleanly into the cup - can\u0026rsquo;t go past it or bang on the sides of the cup, and most importantly, no hands allowed! At the end of our day, I also suspended one of the ships between G6 and B7 to see if they could figure out how to work together to dock, which they really seemed to enjoy. B7 definitely took charge of that one - he directed G6 into a specific position and told her to stay put while he maneuvered the rest. He must have felt really confident about it - rightfully, as he got it first try!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  At station #5, I challenged each of them to pack their personal items for a trip to Mars. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s a catch - the spacecraft is only so big, and has to be a certain weight. Therefore, their selections were required to fit into a box (of arbitrary size) and be under (the arbitrary limit of) 5 pounds. It was cool to see how their opinion of what to bring changed over the course of the time they were working on this.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Finally, station #6 was a crater-drop activity. I collected a variety of different size and weight balls for them to drop into a container of powder, then observed the similarities and differences between balls with different characteristics. We used corn starch as our powder, so we could turn it into oobleck after we finished!\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-activity-day/","tags":null,"title":"Space Activity Day"},{"categories":null,"contents":"G3\u0026rsquo;s third theme request of the school year was snow. I had a lot of fun putting this one together, but I did find that it lent itself more to sensory exploration than numbers, alphabet, and so on, so it was harder to balance out the types of activities. Still, it was a fun day!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  After spending a bit of time coloring out big snowman and identifying our day\u0026rsquo;s associated letter, we dug some lettered jewels out of the snow (flour) where they had been buried. We used them to spell \u0026ldquo;snowman,\u0026rdquo; and then Anna and Elsa got to join in the fun for some sensory free play.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  The previous day, I had collected the cylindrical blocks and cut paper down to size to roll around them. G3 and I made snowman parts for stacking in different combinations. Honestly, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t super into this one and I ended up doing a lot of it, but G5 had a few minutes of fun stacking them later in the day!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I had previously frozen water in a shallow tupperware container, and provided this to G3 along with some watercolor paints, a tiny bit of water, and a paintbrush or two. She enjoyed returning to this activity a couple times throughout the morning to experiment with the ice as it melted and produced different effects on the paint.\n    View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  To squeeze in a bit of counting, I collected a few different snowman \u0026ldquo;parts\u0026rdquo; and we rolled a dice to bnuild our snowman a few parts at a time. I enjoyed seeing what G3 prioritized in her snowman!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  We also made our own snowman dough. G3 measured out all the ingredients and stirred, though I did the part on the stove. Warm playdough is one of my favourite things to play with, and we enjoyed making out snowmen out of bits and pieces I had brought along to give them features.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Finally, we used white silky crayons to draw swirls and whirls on white paper, then watercolored over it to make our blustery day watercolor paints. I had also planned to sprinkle salt on these paintings to create a snowy sort of effect, but activity around the house was picking up with siblings and parents home by this point of the morning and G3 had had enough for the day!\nSomewhere in there we also \u0026ldquo;ice skated\u0026rdquo; around the house on paper plates for a few minutes. I forgot to take a photo though!\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/snow-preschool-day/","tags":null,"title":"Snowy Preschool Day"},{"categories":null,"contents":"G3\u0026rsquo;s second request for her own themed \u0026ldquo;camp\u0026rdquo; day was dinosaurs! I was excited for this one as, while it\u0026rsquo;s a repeat theme from the summer, I could make it 100% geared towards her preschool level skills and interests. Once again, we started off with a big coloring page featuring the letter \u0026ldquo;D.\u0026rdquo; Giving her this sort of activity allowed me to run around and gather the last few supplies on my list so everything was ready to go for the rest of our planned activities!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  She began asking about some of the activities we\u0026rsquo;d done over the summer, particularly the dino dig where I had baked figurines into salt dough. I hope I didn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint her too terribly much when I told her that unfortunately, our dinosaur friends had gotten stuck in icebergs instead! She was stoked, and spent a great deal of time working on freeing them - even making sure to get their heads out first \u0026ldquo;so they can breathe!\u0026rdquo; This was something that we left set up and returned to a few times throughout the morning. When G5 came home from kindy in the late morning, she made quick work of the remaining ice.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I grabbed a few letters from her wooden letter puzzle and buried them in this sandy sort of sensory box (not sure what it is - kids of a mix of normal sand and kinetic sand in texture). She used a shovel and rake tool and a paintbrush to unearth them, and then we worked on identifying the letters to figure out what our fossilized word was.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Would you believe our silly dinosaurs were playing tag and ran smack into a spider\u0026rsquo;s web? Of course we had to help them out and get all the webs off! We worked together on this one as G3 started losing interest at the more challenging points, but we did manage to rescue all four dinos in the end.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  A little 1:1 counting practice was up next. I happen to own a hole punch that works with an amazingly small amount of pressure, which is perfect for little hands. I wish I knew where I got it to recommend, but I honestly have no idea where it came from! Anyways, I had cut out some dinosaur eggs and written a number on them, and G3 punched that many holes.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I was pretty proud of my board game creation! Our dinosaurs had to get away from the erupting volcano to safety, but they could only move if they could identify the letter on the space. I think we allowed each dinosaur a few tries - and my little dimetrodon needed all the help he could get! G3 took great pride in telling my dino when he was wrong and had to stay back until next turn. She\u0026rsquo;s come a long way in her letter identification over the last 2 weeks!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  After G5 got home from kindy and rescued our dinos still stick in ice, we finished up dino day with one final activity. I have a collection of felt shapes that I brought in, and we used them to try to put together pictures of dinosaurs. It was met with medium enthusiasm and low-medium success as a product-driven activity, but the girls both enjoyed undirected free play with the shapes to create whatever they wanted, so it was overall a win.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/dinosaur-preschool/","tags":null,"title":"Dinosaur Preschool Day"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The kids had the whole week off for Thanksgiving break this year! We spent our mornings out on adventures exploring different hiking trails in the area. Of course, I also planned some on-theme activities to do throughout the week.\nOn Monday, I encouraged them to create a poster of things they were thankful for. I made my own as well, mostly to help them get some ideas. G3 gave me direction on what whe wanted written, in whch colour, and where, while she decorated around the words. G5 mysteriously disappeared under the table to work on hers \u0026ldquo;in secret,\u0026rdquo; and then B7 took it one (or two!) steps farther and decided to work on his in his bedroom and also in invisible ink. I love how he decided to make all the handprints and write on the fingers, I thought that was super cute! I encouraged them to continue adding ideas throughout the week, but I think for the most part they stayed as-is.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Tuesday we laid out some picnic rugs in the sunshine and began creating our twisty fall trees using paper grocery bags. G3 and G5 lost interest really quickly, but B7 continued working on his for a while and even more throughout the evening and following day.

We first spent some time turning our clothespins into turkeys. To play our game of tag, we clipped the pins to our shirts.

She talks about our summer camps all the time. Honestly, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought they\u0026rsquo;d made that much of an impact on her since she would drift in and out, playing independently for a good portion of each day. Starting around October, she began asking for more camps. After reminding her that with the school year getting back into full swing, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t really something we could do, but she kept asking so patiently and sweetly that it finally came to me. Her big brother and sister are both in school in some capacity these days, and while she is in her own preschool a few times a week, occasionally - only every couple weeks, generally - there is a day where it\u0026rsquo;s just her and me hanging out for the morning. I immediately told her to pick a theme, and I would design a preschool camp day JUST for her! It was a hard choice, but she eventually picked \u0026ldquo;flowers.\u0026rdquo; Yes, in November. I got to planning, and as soon as my scheduled hours worked out in a way that made it happen, she got her flower camp!\nWe are focusing a lot on letter identification these days. I made her a big poster with the letter F in upper and lowercase, each block letter full of different types of flowers for coloring. Right up her alley, and something she could return to as much as she wanted throughout the day. It also gave us an easy dropcloth for doing other activities and not worrying as much about using trays, which was freeing for the day! And by the end of the day, she was consistently identifying the letter F. Wins all around!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  The other letter-focused activity was making the names of flowers with magnetic letters. I put all the needed letters on the board and told her what word we were making, then asked her to find each letter in order. When she found the right one, she moved it to the other side of the board and eventually put them all in the right order. We worked on this throughout the morning (our magnetic letter set has lots of duplicates, and I\u0026rsquo;d pre-made 8 or so different fower names and divided the groups of letters into a muffin tray.) B7 and G5 also enjoyed their own variation on this game later on in the day. For G5, I told her the name of the flower and she put the letters in order. For B7, I just gave him the scrambled letters; he had to unscramble them without knowing what he was aiming for!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  3 year olds need to move, and my little one is no exception! We took a break from sitting at the table to go for a little walk. We took a box and a pair of scissors, and set to collecting some flowers from around the yard. Thank goodness our climate allows for that! I generally do not let them collect things out of nature unless it is already lying on the ground (and even then, just in their own neighborhood, never out of parks) so this was a special treat, and we talked about only collecting from where the flowers were plentiful. When we returned, we set these aside to dry. At this point, G3 took a break from camp for some independent play - she had focused for a long time!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  When she was ready to come back, I had attached the collected flowers to lollipop sticks and gotten some paint ready for her to experiment with her flowers as natural paintbrushes.

When they identified them, I put them up on the wall in the proper arrangement. Then, I asked them to name any countries they could think of in each continent, and jotted down the names in approximate locations.\nNext, I put up a blank compass rose, and asked them for help filling in the directions. This was actually pretty easy for them as they know a song called \u0026ldquo;Never Eat Soggy Waffles,\u0026rdquo; so it was just a matter of remembering what each one stood for!\nI had a star-shaped sticky note that said \u0026ldquo;you are here,\u0026rdquo; and they were able to quickly find our general location on the map.\nFinally, I got out pictures of landmarks that I had printed and glued onto some cardstock to make them more sturdy. We started with natural landmarks. I gave them one picture with some blue tack, and told them what continent it was in. Once they found the right continent, I used the cardinal directions to guide them to the right placement. Once all the natural landmarks were placed, we did some manmade landmarks. I think I did a pretty decent job of making sure a lot of places were represented, but I am also looking forward to diving deeper into each continent later in the year for more exposure to other cultures.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/world-geography/","tags":null,"title":"Social Studies Focus: World Geography"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Once again, we started off camp by reading the story of the day. For The Snow Queen, I found a version already edited for children, and cut it down a bit further to make it a bit shorter and more concise. The kids enjoyed it! When we finished, I asked them if any parts of it sounded familiar. When they said no, I gave them a couple things to focus on: someone riding a reindeer to go rescue a character from an icy castle, and a character getting so frozen they turned blue, and were only warmed when their best friend gave them a hug and cried. It took a few minutes, but while I was getting supplies set out for our first activity, B7 suddenly shouted out, \u0026ldquo;Elsa!\u0026rdquo; He was really pleased with himself for puzzling it out.\nWe started out by melting the Snow Queen\u0026rsquo;s castle. I had mixed some baking soda with a bit of water - just enough to make it moldable - and pushed it into some small sandcastle molds. I froze them overnight, hoping at the very least to help them set, but also thought they might still be a tiny bit cold. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there was enough water in the mix for them to actually have frozen, but they still stayed in their castle shaped when I popped them out of the molds, so it was a success either way. I set them up in trays on the table. They were actually set up ready before we started the story at the beginning of camp, and I really enjoyed listening to the kids talk about what they thought it was made out of. They had settled on flour and salt, which I did not try to correct. I gave them a cup with a vinegar and water mixture along with some pipettes, and they had a bit of a shock when it started bubbling up! B7 made the connection to the reaction looking the same as what we had for potions class during Harry Potter camp. Even after they finished melting the castles, the girls were really enjoying pouring the watery mixture back and forth, and scooping up the baking soda that hadn\u0026rsquo;t dissolved - it has sort of a slimy texture which they enjoyed exploring.\nWe have found a youtube channel that we really like for drawing tutorials called the Art for Kids Hub. We discovered it during Dino Days, and really like the style of instruction, as well as seeing the kid\u0026rsquo;s drawing next to the grown-up\u0026rsquo;s! We used this resource again to learn to draw reindeer.\nThe previous day, I had put a squirt of paint in each cup of an ice cube tray, mixed it with water, stuck half a popsicle stick in for a handle, and stashed them in the freezer. I brought them out now, along with some big sheets of white paper, and they set to work exploring this new style of painting. It was fun to see their reactions to how the quality of the paint changed over time. B7 described it as being like a marker at first, where it would just scrape off the side of the ice block, but as time went on and the ice melted a bit, they started having fun mixing the colours and letting the watery parts run together.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Next, we make some snowflakes by folding up paper into wedges and cutting out shapes. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t practiced this one beforehand because I remembered it from my childhood, but I was a bit surprised at how difficult it was to do the cutting. G5 had to work really hard! I had also totally blanked on how to make it 6-pointed, but 4 pointed did the trick for today. B7 was loving testing out cut shapes and seeing how they looked when it all opened up. He started looking for faces in the forms he made.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Our final activitiy was making origami doves. Nice and simple!

It seemed like maybe the phrase I was hoping to get in response was unfamiliar to them, so I told them that we would all try \u0026ldquo;open, sesame!\u0026rdquo; together, which did the trick!\nWe read my (heavily edited) verion of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves. I started with the original, which I got from Project Gutenberg, and read it through a few times to figure out exactly how much gruesome death and dismemberment was actually necessary for the story to make sense. You can read my version HERE, as long as you promise not to make fun of my ending!\nWhen we finished the story, we talked about different ways to weigh items. Thye immediately came up with the digital scale they see at every doctor\u0026rsquo;s check-up, and even recognised that we weigh fruits and vegetables when we buy them at the grocery store. For our first activity, we used a fulcrum scale made out of a clothes hanger to weigh, well, anything we could find lying around! I had some 1/4 oz lead chip weights from my model airplane flying days lying around, but just called them \u0026ldquo;units\u0026rdquo; so it didn\u0026rsquo;t get too complex.\nNext up, I gave them a treasure hunt to search for the hidden cave (aka, a box where I\u0026rsquo;d stashed the materials for the remaining activity). This was an enormous exercise in teamwork and patience for each of them! G2 and I eventually let G5 and B7 sort it out themselves and went back to the table to do some coloring, just checking in every once in a while to make sure they hadn\u0026rsquo;t gotten themselves turned around. After battling through the measurements for almost 45 minutes, they were so excited to find the treasure!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  The treasure they found was some brown model magic, which everyone was very excited to see! We talked about a couple different ways we could make jars - pinch pots or snakes - and got to work! I realized too late that I\u0026rsquo;d unthinkingly changes \u0026ldquo;jars\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;barrels\u0026rdquo; in my version of the story, so this activity didn\u0026rsquo;t tie in quite as well as I\u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo;ve liked it to, but I just stuck to \u0026ldquo;jars\u0026rdquo; from there on out.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Unfortunately, we had to cut camp a bit short this day as there were other plans in the afternoon.

I found a version already edited for kids, and only wanted to change a few small details. For example, I added a paragraph that showed passage of time between when the miller\u0026rsquo;s daughter and the prince first met, and when they got married.\nOnce we finished the story - which was well-loved by all! - we got right to work on out thread artwork. I had each of the kids draw (or ask me to draw) a shape, and helped them hammer the nails at appropriate intervals. G5 only banged my fingers once! Then, they twisted the string around the nails until they were happy with the design it made. For G2, I held the string and had her point to which nail she wanted it wound around next.\nNext, we played one of my favourite word games: how many words can we make from the letters in \u0026ldquo;Rumplestiltskin\u0026rdquo;? I had pre-sorted some Bananagrams tiles with the right letters to give them a tactile way to shuffle them around.

First up was Brachiosaurus. I gave them each a bit of chalk, told them I was standing at the tip of the tail, and asked them to go mark where they thought the tip of it\u0026rsquo;s nose would be. Off they ran down the sidewalk - of course, Brachiosaurus being 100 feet long, they all underestimated rather severely! We had a 10-foot measuring tape, and B7 proved rather quick at the division needed to know how many times we needed to measure ten feet (for all the different dinos!). Once we measured it out, we drew a long line, and wrote the measurement at the end. Then, we returned to the starting point, and used the other side of the sidewalk to repeat our exercise with T-rex, Ankylosaurus, Dinonychus, and Triceratops.

My mom had found some of those little grow capsules when she was cleaning out her stash of old art supplies and kids activities, and sent them to me in case I could use them.

They sent over an hour refining their designs! G5 and B7 had successful drops, and we all had a laugh when G2\u0026rsquo;s astronaut bounced right out of her spaceship and cracked - she\u0026rsquo;d forgotten to give it a roof. I will definitely be bringing this activity back again at some point, but with more restrictions on available materials.\nI usually let them be in charge of their own snacks. They collect the one or two items they\u0026rsquo;d like in the morning, and are able to eat it whenever they want throughout our camp time. Today, however, before we even left the house, I mentioned that we were going to learn a bit about how astronauts eat in space, and asked if they\u0026rsquo;d chosen their snacks wisely. I collected all their chosen snacks into a bag and said that just this once, we\u0026rsquo;d be eating together. While they were busy focusing on their egg drop experiment, I took a few moments to stick a bit of velcro on the backs of their snacks. I brought up a video of Chris Hadfield explaining the food situation on the ISS, and while they were watching, I rolled out a long strip of velcro on the table and stuck all their snacks to it. I also included a large-ish tupperware container for a trash can. Their challenge was to pretend they were in space while they were eating their snack - they\u0026rsquo;d have to make sure it was in their hand or velcroed to the table, otherwise it would float away! They looked a little skeptical, but started on their way. I was watching like a hawk for any slip-up, and soon enough, G2 set her wrapper down on the table, so I picked it up and started wandering away. She chased after me as soon as she noticed, and that\u0026rsquo;s when the fun really began! G5 and B7 had both chosen seaweed strips, which they had to make sure stayed in their container, and getting the lid off the trash can while keeping hold of their food and the wrapper was a challenge for everyone. G5 ended up becoming the designated runner as she would always be the first to notice anyone\u0026rsquo;s snack or wrapper drifting away and chase after it while laughing!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Following snack time, we made our nebulas. I showed them some pictures - I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;ve seen any before, because they were in awe! We did some of what I call \u0026ldquo;Rorschach style\u0026rdquo; painting because it gets all blobby. We folded our papers in half, globbed a bit of paint on one side, then folded it over so it had a mirror image pattern. We smushed the paint around while it was folded over to give it more of a \u0026ldquo;cloudy\u0026rdquo; effect like nebulas. Once they were dry, I offered each of the kids a couple of my space stickers to add a planet, spaceship, or astronaut to their nebula - stickers are a huge hit around these parts and they\u0026rsquo;d never seen my space ones before, so that was exciting for them!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Next, we made tiny rockets to launch off the ends of straws. It was a little finnicky for G5 and G2, but we got everyone going eventually! B7 even decided to just make his out of tape.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  By this point it was lunchtime, bringing us to the end of space camp week! I told the kids it was all done, and they all got really quiet. B7 asked if I had one more activity planned that we hadn\u0026rsquo;t had time to do, and if they could please have a late lunch to squeeze in one more activity - which is how we ended up finishing off our week by making constellation viewers. I had the kids help me cover the ends with construction paper and tape, then I poked the holes. I made them the constellations I can always find the easiest, and only the most obvious stars from each to keep it simple for now. We ended up with the Big Dipper, Orion, Cassiopeia, and Cygnus.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  ","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-5/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 5"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We started off Thursday by heading to a spot down the street that I was reasonably confident would stay sunny throughout the day. We traced our shadows around 10, 11, 12, and then later in the afternoon around 3 to watch how they moved and changed throughout the day! B7 had a previous understanding of this and was fantastic at explaining to his sisters what would happen and why, which was pretty cool. As we worked on this, we talked a bit about how sundials work to tell time.\nWhen we returned home, I asked to collect their chosen stuffed animals (I had asked them each to bring one to camp with them), and led them to a pile of all the recycling I\u0026rsquo;ve been hoarding for the last week or so: boxes, fruit clamshells, bottlecaps, TP tubes, I think there was even a sport drink tablet container in there! Their task: to create a spaceship for their animal astronaut. Their supplies: Any recycling they could find, plus a roll of masking tape apiece. I had brought along my boxcutter and told them that anywhere they wanted the cardboard cut, they could draw a line and I would cut it for them, but beyond that, they were on their own! I was amazed at their creativity. G2 wanted lots of circle-ish shaped cut out, which she glued together in a stack to make a \u0026ldquo;chair\u0026rdquo; for her astro-bunnies. G5 went with a basic rectangular prism box design, but spent a lot of time taping on lids and other small objects for buttons and drawing clocks and other gauges. B7 had a \u0026ldquo;go big or go home\u0026rdquo; attitude about it - he immediately started lining up boxes and cutting out the sides to make one long inside chamber, then took a page out of G5\u0026rsquo;s book to add in dials and buttons. I was so impressed by all three of them!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  We watched a quick video on how astronauts exercise in space, and spoke for a few moments about why that is important. This led us to talking about long durations in space, which in turn was a perfect lead-up to start talking about Mars! I showed them some pictures taken by rovers of the martian landscape. Then, we got to work on a new art project: a Marsscape. To start with, I had them sketch out a horison line, and then paint in their sky. We had to let that part dry, and ended up returning to this activity later in the afternoon to finish up. We re-drew our horizons, then sketched out a few foreground details like rocks, small hills, and (my favourite part) tracks from the rover as though we were taking a picture of where we had been. Then, we used a paint brush to put glue only exactly where we wanted it, and started mixing up colored sand to create a whole range of hues across the red/orange part of the colour wheel! It was a blast!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Our last activity of the morning was a meteoroid toss. I had orginally planned on rolling out our distance scale solar system again, but it was too windy, so instead, we used a few boxed that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been turned into rocketships and labelled them with celestial bodies - the kids chose Jupiter for the biggest, Saturn for the medium-sized one, and Moon for the smallest. They had a bit of fun throwing our foil ball meteoroids around, and while we had a brief chat about the difference between meteor, meteoroid, and meteorite, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect those differences to stick!\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-4/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 4"},{"categories":null,"contents":"On Wednesday, we started out by painting our own planets! I\u0026rsquo;d picked up a large styrofoam ball for each of the kids, and we came back to this activity a few times throughout the day so they could let it dry between painting different sections, making it easier to hold. I was surprised that both of the older kids chose blue and green to make earth-like planets. We\u0026rsquo;d talked before we started about all the different ways that we could get lots of different colors just on earth (grey for rocks, yellow sand, red lava, white snow, and so on), but they were happy with their creations, so I can\u0026rsquo;t complain!\nNext, we pulled out or distance scale model of the solar system and played Saturn Ring Toss, using both a ring-style frisbee as well as a pool diving ring. B5 was the first to finally get his ring around Saturn, and moved on to aiming for Uranus while B5 worked on Saturn for a while longer.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  We watched a video about how astronauts brush their teeth (B7 was so relieved to hear that the water sticks to the toothbrush - he had some concerns!), then I let the kids explore the Night Sky app on my phone for a few minutes while I got the supplies out for the next activity. They thought that was so cool - I\u0026rsquo;ll have to remember to take them out for some early evening star gazing in the winter when it starts getting dark before their bedtime!\nWe started our first constellation activity of the week by drawing with a white crayon on white paper - yep, you read that right! I told them to make dots all over the paper, and that these dots were going to be our stars. Then, we used watercolor paints to cover our paper, and the crayon dots showed through. In a stroke of luck, B7 had read a book the week before that had talked about wax resist painting on Ukranian easter eggs, so I brought that back up briefly to point out how it worked. The kids didn\u0026rsquo;t have as precise and defined \u0026ldquo;stars\u0026rdquo; as me, so after they finished painting their papers, we used mine to hunt for our own constellations (though G5 did find a seagull in hers!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Our final activity of Wednesday was a follow-along art video to learn to draw an astronaut. We have really enjoyed this style of art activity ever since the schools switched to distance learning due to COVID-19 and B7\u0026rsquo;s art teacher did his lessons in this style.\nOnce we finished, the kids begged to get the Oobleck back out. We had let it try up overnight, so I gave it to them with a pitcher of water so they could have control over the texture for themselves, which they really enjoyed. This came back out every day of the week (keeping our hands nice and blue!) They even asked to keep it at the end of the week, but I said we would make them one that didn\u0026rsquo;t have any dye inside to explore int he future.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-3/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 3"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The first thing I had the kids do on Tuesday was make a design on some construction paper to set out for solar printing.

I had used a bit of red paper in my design, though, and that was completely bleached out - so I made that mental note for the future.\nWe finished up our ribbon rockets. It took us a few minutes to get the movement pattern in sync to slide them back and forth, but once they got going, we really enjoyed it!\nAfter this, I set them up with some Galaxy oobleck. I started with the cornstarch, and added the water a little bit at a time. THey started squishing it around and honestly, this is the biggest sensory hit I\u0026rsquo;ve had! They loved the soft texture of the cornstarch, and once we got it to a proper non-newtonian fluid, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep their hands out of it. I added some black, blue, and purple food coloring for them to swirl around as they played, as well as pearl cake decorations and glitter for stars.

We went to have a peek at our solar art, which was a disappointing couple of minutes. We decided to leave them there for another couple days to see if they made a better print, and then the kids went back to the oobleck for the rest of the morning. B7 chose instead to make his comet model (the other kids did them in spare time as the week continued), which I never grabbed a picture of - basically, we tied three different colors of ribbon around a stick to represent the three different parts of the tail (shorter ribbon for the coma, and longer ribbons for the gas and dust trails), then scrunched alfoil around the end for the nucleus of the comet.

When G5 picked out that card, I pulled up some pictures from New Horizons to show the difference, and she used that as her example photo instead.\nNext, I stacked the planets in order and asked them to lay each out across the yard where they thought it belonged. I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell them they were in order (which is how we got Saturn next to Venus here), and it was pretty interesting to see how they chose to lay them out.

We marked the location of the sun at the end of their driveway, and then took 6 steps forward, where we marked Mercury. I then asked them to run ahead and guess where the next planet would be.

We took turns drawing the name of a forest animal from a jar, and creating their home on our paper using our nature walk collection, and markers for anything we couldn\u0026rsquo;t make with these materials.

We started off with a bit of an adventure through the jungle. I told the story of our jungle trek as we used yoga poses and other motions to demonstrate the animals and other sights we encountered. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I\u0026rsquo;ll plan again - the kids needed some prodding to get into it and weren\u0026rsquo;t overly enthused - but once they gave it a chance, you could see some glimmers of enjoyment that they were trying (unsuccessfully) to hide. I\u0026rsquo;d mostly done this for G2, as she is always making shapes with her body and asking what it looks like, or showing off her downward dog pose.\nNext up, I started showing them how to make pony bead lizards - is that a throwback to 1998 or what? B7 got the hang of it pretty quickly. It was a lot of focus on more advanced fine motor for G5; she did a few rows at a time and then I\u0026rsquo;d do 1 or 2 to get her going again. G2 made a lovely necklace (I gave her the lizard I made alongside them so she wasn\u0026rsquo;t left out of having one at the end).\nNext up was a sloth race. Whoever got to the finish last wins! The catch is that you always do need to be moving forward. It ended up not working very well to race next to each other, and instead, we used a timer and raced the clock and the leaderboard.\nWhile G2 was at her swimming lesson, the older two and I did another more focus-driven craft: origami jumping frogs. First, I showed them pictures of poison dart frogs, and they chose which sort of frog they wanted to make. We chose our colours of paper, folded the frogs, and then used markers to add the right markings and other colours.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Would you believe that some rainforest animals came to visit our local park the night before our camp? They even left us some footprints to find as we explored!

This was definitely a product-based art project, which isn\u0026rsquo;t very like me, but I though they had a bit of merit in the motor skills needed for their construction, and plus, turning them into marionettes gave the kids a type of toy they\u0026rsquo;d never explored before! We worked on them in stages throughout the day to make sure the paint and glue had sufficient time to dry. I also brought in my hot glue gun on Friday and we did giraffe surgery, making the marionette handle a bit sturdier and making sure googly eyes and limbs were all secure.\nNext, we went on a little safari. I would\u0026rsquo;ve loved to preset this one but since it was going to be spread out in a park with a bit of traffic, I decided to just ask my kiddos to give me a couple minutes to set it up when we got there. While they waited at the side of the field, I scattered the savanna animals around. Then, I gave each of them a paper where they could write down what they found on their safari, and how many. They had fun running around for a while looking for all the critters, and once they were finished exploring, we went and collected them all (bonus activity!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  After spending a few minutes on the next steps of our giraffes, I set up an elephant \u0026ldquo;race,\u0026rdquo; minute-to-win-it style. I got the bowling pins out of their set, and had a pair of grey tights with a tenning ball in the foot for a trunk. We put the waist of the tights over our heads and used the trunk to knock down the pins.\nOur final activity of the day was \u0026ldquo;Mr. Hippopotamus.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;d found a write up of the yard game \u0026ldquo;Mr. Crocodile\u0026rdquo; online but honestly, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t like the chant. I changed the animal (I needed another syllable) and made it a call-and-response:\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Hippopotamus, can we cross the river?\u0026rdquo;\n(The Hippo answers yes or no - if \u0026ldquo;yes,\u0026rdquo; everyone can cross safely, and the game repeats. If no\u0026hellip;)\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Hippopotamus, what\u0026rsquo;s your favourite colour?\u0026rdquo;\nAt this point it\u0026rsquo;s the same as the crocodile game.

We made play dough using 2 parts cornflour to 1 part hair conditioner, then I gave them some creative control over what food coloring drops to add to try and get it to turn brown. We all ended up with some variation on green, interestingly enough! Then I told them the more interesting part about wombat poop: that it is cube-shaped. We spent some time shaping our playdough into cubes. I let them know that there was one more interesting fact about wombats, but we\u0026rsquo;d come back to this activity at the end of camp, and I would tell them then.\nNext up was a little game with kangaroo pouches. I had some scrap \u0026ldquo;tshirt\u0026rdquo; type fabric that was long enough to tie around each kiddo\u0026rsquo;s belly to make a pouch. I scattered some of their stuffies around the yard, and asked them how many joeys they thought they could fit in their pouch, then we all hopped around while they tried to collect them all. It was only a quick game before it got too repetative, but pretty fun for those few minutes!\nNext, we sat down to do an art project. I showed them examples of the dot painting done by aboriginal people of Australia, and gave them stencils I\u0026rsquo;d made of some common Aussie animals to make their own. They ended up really getting into this one, which was pretty cool. B7 made two different ones that were more simple, and G5 really took her time filling up an entire paper on the snake design that she chose.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Next up, we talked about flying foxes a bit. I could\u0026rsquo;ve fit bats in most of the days this week, but when I needed another movement activity for my Australian theme, I decided it could land here! I showed them some pictures of flying foxes so they could get a sense of how big they are, then we played an echolocation game. They were blindfolded, and bounced a ball against a wall. They then decided how close they were: they could choose to either take a step forward, or decide that they were close enough to the wall to touch it and remove the blindfold to check. Then, someone would bring the ball back to them, and they\u0026rsquo;d repeat until they were happy with their distance!\nFollowing our exploration of echolocation, we revisited the wombat poop, which had dried up a little. I shared my last wombat poop fun fact with them: wombats not only poop in cubes, but they also stack it up! We spent the rest of camp time stacking our wombat poop and seeing how high we could get our piles built.\nI\u0026rsquo;d had one more craft activity planned for the day, but as a pretty basic cut-and-paste \u0026ldquo;product art\u0026rdquo; activity I wasn\u0026rsquo;t chomping at the bit to include it.

On the way to work I stopped and picked up a small bag of ice from the supermarket. I dumped the ice into the water table, and set the ice blocks with animals on top. I supplied a few cups of water (and had a pitcher nearby for refills), pipettes, and a couple screwdrivers for my kiddos to use on their rescue mission. As they freed the animals, we identified them and they started to figure out what all they had in common, eventually coming up with the theme for the day: animals of the arctic.\nThe week\u0026rsquo;s theme was animals, but I could hardly visit the arctic without talking about the aurora borealis. I showed them some pictures, then we did marble painting in greens, purples, and blues.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I knew I needed some sort of \u0026ldquo;blubber\u0026rdquo; activity, but with only a couple of kids, it didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to just line up and dip your hand in cold water with and without the insulation - I wanted my kiddos to get a little more out of it than just \u0026ldquo;fat keeps you warm.\u0026rdquo; I asked them for some ideas of how animals stayed warm in the cold of the arctic. They came up with fur, fat, and shelter (I loved hearing shelter from G5 - I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even considered that as a possible answer!) Then, we tested out all different insulators (in the icy water table, now that it had melted a little more - no need to get more bowls, ice, or water!) I used produce bags to hold yarn (for \u0026ldquo;fur\u0026rdquo;), feathers, a little fabric sleeve I\u0026rsquo;d sewn (to mimic just being a person wearing a shirt), and finally, the Crisco. I had some rubber gloves for them to put on in case they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get their hand in the Crisco (B7 and G5 used the glove, G2 didn\u0026rsquo;t touch the Crisco at all). I made data collection pages for them to write which insulator they were testing, and how it felt to them. It was really cool to hear their descriptions and how they chose to take data. You can see how B7 wrote numbers in some rows - he\u0026rsquo;s saying that he could keep just his hand, as a control, in the water for 28 seconds, then said probably about 100 seconds for the yarn, and what looks to be approximately 1 trillion for the blubber - just \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  Next up was following along a how-to-draw video on youtube. We do this about once a week these days. It started during distance learning when B7\u0026rsquo;s art teacher was doing this style of art classes over Zoom, and both B7 and G5 really enjoy it! To fit our arctic theme, we drew narwhals.\nOur final activity of the day was charades. Since they were new to the game, and since the animals weren\u0026rsquo;t as familiar to them, I made a poster of choices that both the actor and the guessers could see. I left them unlabelled in my preparation, so the first thing we did was identify them, then we were off! The parents have told me that they\u0026rsquo;ve played a couple evenings as well.

You may (rightfully) wonder how on earth we managed that with only 4 people, one of whom was 2 years old, and it definitely took some thought. I set it up as more of a race. The chaser would start holding the Quaffle (soccer ball) at one end of the yard. They would run to throw it in a ring on the other end. On the way back, they turned into a Seeker and try to catch the snitch (tennis ball) as it was tossed to them. The remaining two players were beaters. They each had a soft ball and an area they needed to stand, one on each side. They could throw their ball to try to hit the chaser/seeker at any time until they were back across the starting line. We just rotated around positions a few times until everyone was satisfied! One point each for scoring with the quaffle or catching the snitch, but no points if you were hit by a bludger.\nThat was it! We had a little more free time this day, when they played a bit more pin-the-scar to try and squeak out those last couple house points. I had them count their beads and tell me in secret, then, while they were eating their lunch, I announced the winner of the house cup.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/harry-potter-camp-day-5/","tags":null,"title":"Harry Potter Camp Day 5"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We had another letter arrive by owl post today.

They kept getting stuck in a certain place, but for a long time they weren\u0026rsquo;t at all willing to experiment. B7 finally solved the maze by - literally - army crawling the whole entire thing!\nAfter working a little more on our snitches, we made bleach-resist tshirts. I had cut out carboard shapes of a few popular symbols from the Harry Potter universe, and one by one, they chose where they wanted them to show up on their shirt. Then, I asked them to stand back, and sprayed bleach over the shirts. They were rather amazed by the color changing so quickly (and I was rather thankful - I\u0026rsquo;d tested it at home the night before and it hadn\u0026rsquo;t worked nearly as quickly or vividly as I\u0026rsquo;d hoped, so I was over the moon with how well it worked when it counted!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt)\n  I needed a few minutes to rinse the shirts and throw them in the washer, so I set them up with a follow-along art video.

Today, we drew unicorns.\nFinally, we played \u0026ldquo;petrificus totalus\u0026rdquo; tag. You guessed it - freeze tag! We all said \u0026ldquo;petrificus totalus\u0026rdquo; when we were freezing someone, and \u0026ldquo;finite\u0026rdquo; when unfreezing our teammates. In hindsight, I should have done this earlier in the week before introducing the whomping willow game, as it was a bit lackluster without the extra rescue element.\nWhen we had some free time at the end, they asked to play more Whomping Willow, and then we did a few more building challenges with our troll bogies.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/harry-potter-camp-day-4/","tags":null,"title":"Harry Potter Camp Day 4"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We started off the day with a challenge: could they make Harry\u0026rsquo;s glasses - and attach a scar - using pipe cleaners?\nOnce they were happy with their glasses, we headed to the park for a couple activities.\nFirst was Basilisk Bubbles.

Dip them in bubble solution, then blow through the mouth opening where you would normally drink, and a big foamy snake of bubbles comes out the other side. We experimented with adding food coloring to try to get them green, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have heaps of luck.

I gave each of them a blown up balloon, and we did variations on races (forwards, backwards, hopping on one foot, and so on) while keeping the balloon in the air. It was a little windy this day, so we made our race distances super short, and while they occasionally struggled to keep control of their balloon, it was still a lot of fun!\nHeading back home, we added another layer of paint to our snitches, then played The Whomping Willow. I had a little stuffed mouse named Scabbers sitting at one end of the yard. One player is the \u0026ldquo;Whomping Willow.\u0026rdquo; The remaining players must work together to rescue Scabbers and bring him safely to the other end of the yard. The Whomping Wilow (who can move) tries to tag all the other players, who then are frozen. They can be unfrozen by their teammates. If the team can get Scabbers to safety, they win, but if the Whomping Willow freezes everyone before Scabbers is rescued, then the Willow would win.\nThis day, we had a friend of B7 come to join us.

Instead, I kpet them indoors until everything was ready to go, and when I led them into the outdoor camp space, they found a little owl on the table with letters for each of them. I just re-wrote the Hogwarts letter from book 1 to suit my needs.\nNext, we chose our houses. I\u0026rsquo;d had a backup activity planned to prevent drama over who would be in which house, but luckily, they all happily chose different houses, so we were good to go with B7 as Hufflepuff, G5 as Gryffindor, and G2 as Slytherin. I showed them the jars and bead stash for house points, and let them start with 5 each. We came back to this throughout the week. They earned points for winning games, doing their best work on projects, or doing something unusually nice or thoughtful, and lost points for poor behaviour.\nUp next was making wands. I had collected suitable sticks and scattered them around a little grove of trees in the local park. I also made a bowtruckle out of pipe cleaners and some fake leaves I had lying around. I introduced them to Pickett and explained that bowtruckles only live in trees that feel magical, and he would help us be able to tell which sticks would be good wand-wood. (This gave me an easy out when G2 grabbed what was essentially a dried out 4-foot long bush - Pickett just said it wasn\u0026rsquo;t magical!) We walked to the local park and found our sticks. Pickett would let the kids know when they had something that was wand wood, and also (speaking through me) let them know that they could keep looking until they found one that felt \u0026ldquo;powerful.\u0026rdquo; (Idk, it seemed like a good idea to draw out the activity and make it so they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel forced to stick with the first thing they picked up.) Anyways, it worked pretty well, and we took the sticks back home to turn into wands. I gave them each a bit of clay to turn into a handle, and then let them choose their \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; - red feathers for phoenix feathers, white ribbon for unicorn hair, and red embroidery floss for dragon heartstring. We put those on the inside of the handles so they were completely contained.

I used a no-cook playdough recipe (the usual cream of tartar recipe, but with a smaller amount of boiling water instead of cooking it on the stove) and let them choose which colours to mix in to create a lovely greenish yellow booger colour.

Ms. Frizzle said it best: “Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!” I find that in most cases, routine is helpful, but having the flexibility to know when to throw it out is also important. I meet a child where they currently are developmentally, and provide scaffolding to reach the next step. In day to day life, this plays out in a number of ways, depending on children’s ages and stages. I generally encourage children to participate in their own day to day care and the “maintenance” of daily life. I provide opportunities to explore new environments and concepts, both in the home and out and about. Turning mistakes into teachable moments is paramount, and I often find that taking a step back myself allows for more connections to be made as a child thinks through their options and creates a plan. Exposure to music, language, and literacy are important to me, and I incorporate these activities into daily plans. While I occasionally find that adult intervention is necessary to resolve an issue (particularly if it involves another child), I typically expect children to have worked on a solution for themselves before coming to an adult for help - in an age appropriate fashion, of course! Helping to raise respectful, curious, and independent children is why I do what I do.\nHow do all of these ideas look in practice? To one child, this might mean climbing just a little bit higher on the jungle gym. I’ll be there to catch them, but it is up to the child to test their limits in balance and strength, and learn what happens when they exceed their abilities. To another child, this could look like them trying out what happens if they start shouting and making demands, rather than asking for help. I’ll be their example and practice partner for how they can best ask questions and negotiate for things they want. As I keep an eye on their development, I will see what accomplishment they are nearing, and set up the environment to make that more accessible.\nThere is no one specific childcare philosophy that I adhere to, but I am constantly looking for new material that supports my basic idea about interacting with the environment. While I am not trained in RIE, I can use the idea of a “yes space” to better design an area for a baby to explore without needing constant input from me - and eliminating the need for me to disallow certain actions. While I wouldn’t necessarily call play “work” like Montessori teachers do, I love to involve children in everyday tasks like preparing meals, wiping up spills, and putting dirty clothes in the appropriate place. As a self-described “artsy-crafty” person, I’m drawn to the idea of Waldorf education and bring movement and visual arts into many academic or cognitive based goals, but I still see a role for store-purchased toys.\nThere are a couple of hot topics that could use special comment:\nScreentime: Generally I don’t find it to add a whole lot of value to the daily routine and avoid the use of movies, shows, and ipad games. I appreciate the ability to use my own discretion to use the internet as a resource for information, use spotify for playing music, or yes, that occasional screens-as-entertainment scenario for an unusual day where it makes sense.\nNews Stories: I will follow your lead, but I won’t lie. Give me a heads up if there’s a “party line” on an issue. Typically, I encourage children to explain to me what they know, and allow them to draw conclusions on their own, only adding questions to their musing to pull them back on the right track if their imagination has derailed the information available to them. I’ll generally give you a heads up if a hard topic has come up during the day, and if I suspect the answer to a question is a bit too far for my role, I will redirect with something like “I’m not sure what your parent’s thoughts are on this topic, why don’t you ask that when you next see them.”\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/childcare-philosophy/","tags":null,"title":"Childcare Philosophy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"What childcare experience do you have?

I am currently open to mornings-only or full time arrangements.\nWhat was your childhood like? Busy! My parents supported and encouraged my younger siblings and I through an ever-expanding list of activities and interests, from music, swim, and gymnastics lessons to graciously thanking me for the 547th keychain I\u0026rsquo;d braided.\nCan you work in a home with pets? Absolutely! I have no pet allergies and love being around animals. If you have pets in your home I\u0026rsquo;ll of course have some questions for you - and I reserve the right to draw the line at snakes and spiders!\nDo you drive? I am a safe and cautious driver, and have a perfect driving record. I do require that a vehicle is provided by the family for transportation during work.\nAre you first aid trained? Yes! I keep my certification current, taking an in-person first aid/CPR class every two years. I have also had lifeguard and winderness first aid training.\nCan you cook? I like to think so! I\u0026rsquo;ll never claim to be a chef, but I have a growing collection of tried-and-true recipes that I use both at work and in my home life. I cook primarily \u0026ldquo;from scratch,\u0026rdquo; avoiding canned soups and frozen dinners. I love to involve children in the kitchen with age-appropriate tasks!\nCan you swim? I am a strong swimmer, and confident caring for children at both pool and beach settings. I have taken lifeguard training through Red Cross, though my certification has lapsed.\nDo you have experience with children with special needs? For five summers during university, I worked as a classroom aide in a school for children with developmental disabilities. Particularly, I was placed in a classroom of non-ambulatory children, from ages three up to early teens. Most of these children were also non-verbal, and any activity we did required significant adaptation between the students to ensure they each gained something from the experience. As I was studying music therapy at the time, I also arranged with the school to provide occasional music experience sessions to other classrooms in the building. As a music therapy student, I worked under instruction of board certified music therapists to create and implement music sessions with different populations, including several groups of children with both developmental disabilities and behavioral disorders.\nHow else can you help my family? I am first and foremost a childcare provider. However, I can help out your family in other ways when I am not directly responsible for taking care of children - during naptime, or during school hours for older children. I have great organizational skills, am willing to do a bit of light cleaning, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s child-related, and enjoy cooking.
