[{"categories":null,"contents":"We started off THursday by heading to a spot down the street that I was reasonably confident would stay sunny throughout the day. We traced our shadows around 10, 11, 12, and then later in the afternoon around 3 to watch how they moved and changed throughout the day! B7 had a previous understanding of this and was fantastic at explaining to his sisters what would happen and why, which was pretty cool. As we worked on this, we talked a bit about how sundials work to tell time.\nWhen we returned home, I asked to collect their chosen stuffed animals (I had asked them each to bring one to camp with them), and led them to a pile of all the recycling I\u0026rsquo;ve been hoarding for the last week or so: boxes, fruit clamshells, bottlecaps, TP tubes, I think there was even a sport drink tablet container in there! Their task: to create a spaceship for their animal astronaut. Their supplies: Any recycling they could find, plus a roll of masking tape apiece. I had brought along my boxcutter and told them that anywhere they wanted the cardboard cut, they could draw a line and I would cut it for them, but beyond that, they were on their own! I was amazed at their creativity. G2 wanted lots of circle-ish shaped cut out, which she glued together in a stack to make a \u0026ldquo;chair\u0026rdquo; for her astro-bunnies. G5 went with a basic rectangular prism box design, but spent a lot of time taping on lids and other small objects for buttons and drawing clocks and other gauges. B7 had a \u0026ldquo;go big or go home\u0026rdquo; attitude about it - he immediately started lining up boxes and cutting out the sides to make one long inside chamber, then took a page out of G5\u0026rsquo;s book to add in dials and buttons. I was so impressed by all three of them!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 23, 2020 at 1:36pm PDT\n  We watched a quick video on how astronauts exercise in space, and spoke for a few moments about why that is important. This led us to talking about long durations in space, which in turn was a perfect lead-up to start talking about Mars! I showed them some pictures taken by rovers of the martian landscape. Then, we got to work on a new art project: a Marsscape. To start with, I had them sketch out a horison line, and then paint in their sky. We had to let that part dry, and ended up returning to this activity later in the afternoon to finish up. We re-drew our horizons, then sketched out a few foreground details like rocks, small hills, and (my favourite part) tracks from the rover as though we were taking a picture of where we had been. Then, we used a paint brush to put glue only exactly where we wanted it, and started mixing up colored sand to create a whole range of hues across the red/orange part of the colour wheel! It was a blast!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 2:44pm PDT\n  Our last activity of the morning was a meteoroid toss. I had orginally planned on rolling out our distance scale solar system again, but it was too windy, so instead, we used a few boxed that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been turned into rocketships and labelled them with celestial bodies - the kids chose Jupiter for the biggest, Saturn for the medium-sized one, and Moon for the smallest. They had a bit of fun throwing our foil ball meteoroids around, and while we had a brief chat about the difference between meteor, meteoroid, and meteorite, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect those differences to stick!\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-4/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 4"},{"categories":null,"contents":"On Wednesday, we started out by painting our own planets! I\u0026rsquo;d picked up a large styrofoam ball for each of the kids, and we came back to this activity a few times throughout the day so they could let it dry between painting different sections, making it easier to hold. I was surprised that both of the older kids chose blue and green to make earth-like planets. We\u0026rsquo;d talked before we started about all the different ways that we could get lots of different colors just on earth (grey for rocks, yellow sand, red lava, white snow, and so on), but they were happy with their creations, so I can\u0026rsquo;t complain!\nNext, we pulled out or distance scale model of the solar system and played Saturn Ring Toss, using both a ring-style frisbee as well as a pool diving ring. B5 was the first to finally get his ring around Saturn, and moved on to aiming for Uranus while B5 worked on Saturn for a while longer.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 7:27pm PDT\n  We watched a video about how astronauts brush their teeth (B7 was so relieved to hear that the water sticks to the toothbrush - he had some concerns!), then I let the kids explore the Night Sky app on my phone for a few minutes while I got the supplies out for the next activity. They thought that was so cool - I\u0026rsquo;ll have to remember to take them out for some early evening star gazing in the winter when it starts getting dark before their bedtime!\nWe started our first constellation activity of the week by drawing with a white crayon on white paper - yep, you read that right! I told them to make dots all over the paper, and that these dots were going to be our stars. Then, we used watercolor paints to cover our paper, and the crayon dots showed through. In a stroke of luck, B7 had read a book the week before that had talked about wax resist painting on Ukranian easter eggs, so I brought that back up briefly to point out how it worked. The kids didn\u0026rsquo;t have as precise and defined \u0026ldquo;stars\u0026rdquo; as me, so after they finished painting their papers, we used mine to hunt for our own constellations (though G5 did find a seagull in hers!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 22, 2020 at 10:49pm PDT\n  Our final activity of Wednesday was a follow-along art video to learn to draw an astronaut. We have really enjoyed this style of art activity ever since the schools switched to distance learning due to COVID-19 and B7\u0026rsquo;s art teacher did his lessons in this style.\nOnce we finished, the kids begged to get the Oobleck back out. We had let it try up overnight, so I gave it to them with a pitcher of water so they could have control over the texture for themselves, which they really enjoyed. This came back out every day of the week (keeping our hands nice and blue!) They even asked to keep it at the end of the week, but I said we would make them one that didn\u0026rsquo;t have any dye inside to explore int he future.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-3/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 3"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The first thing I had the kids do on Tuesday was make a design on some construction paper to set out for solar printing. Unfortunately, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work nearly as well as I\u0026rsquo;d hoped it would! By the end of the day, hardly anything showed up on our black paper. I had used a bit of red paper in my design, though, and that was completely bleached out - so I made that mental note for the future.\nWe finished up our ribbon rockets. It took us a few minutes to get the movement pattern in sync to slide them back and forth, but once they got going, we really enjoyed it!\nAfter this, I set them up with some Galaxy oobleck. I started with the cornstarch, and added the water a little bit at a time. THey started squishing it around and honestly, this is the biggest sensory hit I\u0026rsquo;ve had! They loved the soft texture of the cornstarch, and once we got it to a proper non-newtonian fluid, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep their hands out of it. I added some black, blue, and purple food coloring for them to swirl around as they played, as well as pearl cake decorations and glitter for stars. They were mesmerized!\nTurns out they also enjoy having dark blue hands. We were all looking a little smurf-like this week!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 22, 2020 at 7:19am PDT\n  After watching our \u0026ldquo;how does it work in space\u0026rdquo; video of the day (hair washing), we were pretty much out of time! We went to have a peek at our solar art, which was a disappointing couple of minutes. We decided to leave them there for another couple days to see if they made a better print, and then the kids went back to the oobleck for the rest of the morning. B7 chose instead to make his comet model (the other kids did them in spare time as the week continued), which I never grabbed a picture of - basically, we tied three different colors of ribbon around a stick to represent the three different parts of the tail (shorter ribbon for the coma, and longer ribbons for the gas and dust trails), then scrunched alfoil around the end for the nucleus of the comet. Not super impressive as an activity, but hopefully they\u0026rsquo;ll remember the general idea of the shape.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-2/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"To kick off space camp, we all worked together to create our own colored versions of each planet. I had a little stack of flashcards with each planet on them (and some facts on the back), and we used those pictures to make our own, plus the sun and a few asteroids. I was really impressed at how hard these kiddos worked to recreate the images faithfully! So much attention to detail. My flashcards were copyright 2009, which means pluto was a bit of a blur. When G5 picked out that card, I pulled up some pictures from New Horizons to show the difference, and she used that as her example photo instead.\nNext, I stacked the planets in order and asked them to lay each out across the yard where they thought it belonged. I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell them they were in order (which is how we got Saturn next to Venus here), and it was pretty interesting to see how they chose to lay them out. (It was a little windy - you can see we used a combination of loose change and random exercise weights to keep everything in place.)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 3:24pm PDT\n  Once they were happy with their setup, we went for a walk. We marked the location of the sun at the end of their driveway, and then took 6 steps forward, where we marked Mercury. I then asked them to run ahead and guess where the next planet would be. They were pretty close on Venus and Earth, but after that, the distances start getting so huge! We ended up most of the way down the street.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 23, 2020 at 8:05pm PDT\n  On our way back, we chatted a lot about the different planets compositions, and how spacecraft that were travelling that far got power. A neighbor down the road happened to have a telescope in his front yard for viewing NEOWISE, so we had a brief chat about that as well, and where the comet appeares in the sky.\nWhen we returned, we fixed up our model! I rolled out a long sheet of butcher paper, and we changed our step scale to a centimeter scale, glueing the planets and other celestial bodies down along the way.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 3:28pm PDT\n  After that, I showed them a video of Samantha Christiforetti demonstrating and giving a tour of the crew sleeping quarters on ISS. After the video, I asked them what other things they\u0026rsquo;d like to learn about how things work differently in space, and jotted down their answers to find videos for the remainder of the week.\nWe were very nearly out of time at this point! They took a few minutes to start turning TP tubes into rockets, but that\u0026rsquo;s now a project for Tuesday.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-1/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 1"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We had another letter arrive by owl post today. Aragog let us know that he\u0026rsquo;d come by and left a challenge, and those who could successfully make it through his web would win house points! I had preset a \u0026ldquo;laser maze\u0026rdquo; with yarn. I did it myself before camp started, so I knew it was possible! It took a while for the kids to really explore different movements. They kept getting stuck in a certain place, but for a long time they weren\u0026rsquo;t at all willing to experiment. B7 finally solved the maze by - literally - army crawling the whole entire thing!\nAfter working a little more on our snitches, we made bleach-resist tshirts. I had cut out carboard shapes of a few popular symbols from the Harry Potter universe, and one by one, they chose where they wanted them to show up on their shirt. Then, I asked them to stand back, and sprayed bleach over the shirts. They were rather amazed by the color changing so quickly (and I was rather thankful - I\u0026rsquo;d tested it at home the night before and it hadn\u0026rsquo;t worked nearly as quickly or vividly as I\u0026rsquo;d hoped, so I was over the moon with how well it worked when it counted!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 18, 2020 at 9:08pm PDT\n  I needed a few minutes to rinse the shirts and throw them in the washer, so I set them up with a follow-along art video. They\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed this format of art ever since B7\u0026rsquo;s art teacher finished up the at-home school year with this style of lesson. Today, we drew unicorns.\nFinally, we played \u0026ldquo;petrificus totalus\u0026rdquo; tag. You guessed it - freeze tag! We all said \u0026ldquo;petrificus totalus\u0026rdquo; when we were freezing someone, and \u0026ldquo;finite\u0026rdquo; when unfreezing our teammates. In hindsight, I should have done this earlier in the week before introducing the whomping willow game, as it was a bit lackluster without the extra rescue element.\nWhen we had some free time at the end, they asked to play more Whomping Willow, and then we did a few more building challenges with our troll bogies.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/harry-potter-camp-day-4/","tags":null,"title":"Harry Potter Camp Day 4"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We started off the day with a challenge: could they make Harry\u0026rsquo;s glasses - and attach a scar - using pipe cleaners?\nOnce they were happy with their glasses, we headed to the park for a couple activities.\nFirst was Basilisk Bubbles. I cut the bottoms off empty plastic waterbottles, and we rubber-banded socks to the opening. Dip them in bubble solution, then blow through the mouth opening where you would normally drink, and a big foamy snake of bubbles comes out the other side. We experimented with adding food coloring to try to get them green, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have heaps of luck. G2 enjoyed playing with the piles of bubbles that were left on the ground once she grew bored of making the snakes.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 18, 2020 at 7:08am PDT\n  Our other park activity was a \u0026ldquo;Wingardrium Leviosa\u0026rdquo; race. I gave each of them a blown up balloon, and we did variations on races (forwards, backwards, hopping on one foot, and so on) while keeping the balloon in the air. It was a little windy this day, so we made our race distances super short, and while they occasionally struggled to keep control of their balloon, it was still a lot of fun!\nHeading back home, we added another layer of paint to our snitches, then played The Whomping Willow. I had a little stuffed mouse named Scabbers sitting at one end of the yard. One player is the \u0026ldquo;Whomping Willow.\u0026rdquo; The remaining players must work together to rescue Scabbers and bring him safely to the other end of the yard. The Whomping Wilow (who can move) tries to tag all the other players, who then are frozen. They can be unfrozen by their teammates. If the team can get Scabbers to safety, they win, but if the Whomping Willow freezes everyone before Scabbers is rescued, then the Willow would win.\nThis day, we had a friend of B7 come to join us. During the free choice time at the end of the morning, he taught us how to draw a landscape of Hogwarts castle. Then, by popular demand, we played a few more rounds of pin-the-scar.\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/harry-potter-camp-day-3/","tags":null,"title":"Harry Potter Camp Day 3"},{"categories":null,"contents":"On Tuesday, the kids came to camp to discover nothing but an owl with a message for them - Peeves had stolen all the supplies for the day\u0026rsquo;s activities! I had made a scavenger hunt with clues that were quotes directly from the books (just the first two, as that\u0026rsquo;s as far as they have gotten so far.) B7 really took to this activity, and I was impressed by his reading.\nOnce they recovered the supplies, we had potions class - a good ol\u0026rsquo; baking soda + vinegar setup. They played with it for ages, and even asked to keep it set up for the rest of the day. I had coloured the vinegar water to allow for some experimentation with colour mixing alongside the chemical reactions.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 17, 2020 at 8:08pm PDT\n  Our remaining two activities were ones that would end up taking a few days to finish up. First we started painting our golden snitches - I think we ended up doing about 4 coats of paint on the styrofoam balls before they were finished. And then we started making our howlers. We got pretty far on those, just leaving the folding for another day once all the glue had dried.\nThere was a bit of free time at the end of the morning. They played with the potions setup a bit longer, but also asked to play more pin-the-scar to keep adding up those house points!\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/harry-potter-camp-day-2/","tags":null,"title":"Harry Potter Camp Day 2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"My kiddos knew that I was running a themed camp this week, but I\u0026rsquo;d asked their mum not to tell them what the theme would be. Instead, I kpet them indoors until everything was ready to go, and when I led them into the outdoor camp space, they found a little owl on the table with letters for each of them. I just re-wrote the Hogwarts letter from book 1 to suit my needs.\nNext, we chose our houses. I\u0026rsquo;d had a backup activity planned to prevent drama over who would be in which house, but luckily, they all happily chose different houses, so we were good to go with B7 as Hufflepuff, G5 as Gryffindor, and G2 as Slytherin. I showed them the jars and bead stash for house points, and let them start with 5 each. We came back to this throughout the week. They earned points for winning games, doing their best work on projects, or doing something unusually nice or thoughtful, and lost points for poor behaviour.\nUp next was making wands. I had collected suitable sticks and scattered them around a little grove of trees in the local park. I also made a bowtruckle out of pipe cleaners and some fake leaves I had lying around. I introduced them to Pickett and explained that bowtruckles only live in trees that feel magical, and he would help us be able to tell which sticks would be good wand-wood. (This gave me an easy out when G2 grabbed what was essentially a dried out 4-foot long bush - Pickett just said it wasn\u0026rsquo;t magical!) We walked to the local park and found our sticks. Pickett would let the kids know when they had something that was wand wood, and also (speaking through me) let them know that they could keep looking until they found one that felt \u0026ldquo;powerful.\u0026rdquo; (Idk, it seemed like a good idea to draw out the activity and make it so they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel forced to stick with the first thing they picked up.) Anyways, it worked pretty well, and we took the sticks back home to turn into wands. I gave them each a bit of clay to turn into a handle, and then let them choose their \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; - red feathers for phoenix feathers, white ribbon for unicorn hair, and red embroidery floss for dragon heartstring. We put those on the inside of the handles so they were completely contained. G2 enjoyed using the leftover core options to decorate the outside of her wand.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 16, 2020 at 8:32am PDT\n  Something that was important to start early in the week was our sorcerer\u0026rsquo;s stones - after all, we had to grow them ourselves! I pre-made the supersaturated sugar solution (which I called \u0026ldquo;elixir,\u0026quot;) but had them roll the lollipop sticks in sugar and mix in the food coloring until they were happy with the shade.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 15, 2020 at 11:16am PDT\n  Once our sorcerer\u0026rsquo;s stones were safely out of the way to grow, we made troll bogies. I used a no-cook playdough recipe (the usual cream of tartar recipe, but with a smaller amount of boiling water instead of cooking it on the stove) and let them choose which colours to mix in to create a lovely greenish yellow booger colour. Once it was ready, we chose slips of paper from a jar and tried to build what it said using our troll bogies.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 16, 2020 at 7:29pm PDT\n  Our last activity of the morning was \u0026ldquo;pin the scar on Harry Potter.\u0026rdquo; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how much they enjoyed this one - mostly I think they enjoyed winning house points (whoever got it the closest, or two points if you got it exactly right) but they also had a great time making adjustments to their strategy, using other landmarks (the sides of the poster or the previously stuck scars) to get a better sense of direction.

I spend my weekends hiking, rock climbing, and paragliding. On more relaxing weekends, a well-stocked cheese board and a few board games are a nice activity with friends. I’m always looking forward to new experiences, as well - a pottery wheel class, archery, or salsa dance night at a local cafe. I studied music therapy at university, and while I’ve gotten out of practice with all the other activities I’ve taken up lately, I play french horn, as well as a bit of piano and guitar. I am always in the middle of a book and enjoy completing a yearly reading prompt challenge. I enjoy writing in my journal, and it’s fun to occasionally read old ones to take a trip down memory lane. I keep an assortment of craft supplies on hand for making cards or adding an extra splash of color to my journals. I am trying to improve my drawing skills, but so far can only copy coloring book-style outlines. Though they live in Ohio, I am close with my family; we video call at least once a week to keep in touch. I listen to all sorts of music, from classical concertos to 60’s and 70’s rock to country, but my favorite is Broadway showtunes. I love Halloween, and will usually start at the end of summer scouring thrift shops to piece together a costume (this year, I am starting to think about Jasmine.)

I am looking forward to getting to know you and your family!\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/about-me/","tags":null,"title":"About Me"},{"categories":null,"contents":"My childcare philosophy hinges on the idea that children learn through interacting with their environment. This opens up into a whole web of topics, each intertwined with the rest. Maintaining a positive environment is important so the child feels safe to explore, try new things, and make mistakes without repercussions aside from the natural consequence. To one child, this might mean climbing just a little bit higher on the jungle gym. I’ll be there to catch them, but it is up to the child to test their limits in balance and strength, and learn what happens when they exceed their abilities. To another child, this could look like them trying out what happens if they start shouting and making demands, rather than asking for help. I’ll be their example and practice partner for how they can best ask questions and negotiate for things they want. As I keep an eye on their development, I will see what accomplishment they are nearing, and set up the environment to make that more accessible.\nThere is no one specific childcare philosophy that I adhere to, but I am constantly looking for new material that supports my basic idea about interacting with the environment. While I am not trained in RIE, I can use the idea of a “yes space” to better design an area for a baby to explore without needing constant input from me - and eliminating the need for me to disallow certain actions. While I wouldn’t necessarily call play “work” like Montessori teachers do, I love to involve children in everyday tasks like preparing meals, wiping up spills, and putting dirty clothes in the appropriate place. As a self-described “artsy-crafty” person, I’m drawn to the idea of Waldorf education and bring movement and visual arts into many academic or cognitive based goals, but I still see a role for store-purchased toys.\nWhat seems to be the magic question these days: what are my views on screen time? If it is left 100% up to me, I only use screen time in very rare and special occasions. Sometimes, a surprise popcorn and movie night for school age kids can be timed perfectly to give them a relaxing night after a jam-packed week of school, homework, sports, and other activities. I tend to avoid it altogether for children preschool age and younger, though, unless it is already established in the family’s routine and the parents are happy the way things are. Otherwise, there’s just too many things to explore!\nHelping to raise respectful, curious, and independent children is why I do what I do. I think Ms. Frizzle said it best: “Time to take chances, make mistakes, get messy!”\n","permalink":"https://www.nannyblt.com/childcare-philosophy/","tags":null,"title":"Childcare Philosophy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"What childcare experience do you have? I have been an in-home childcare provider since 2013. Prior to that, I was a classroom aide for five summers, and during those school years I ran practicum sessions as a student music therapist, including in schools. Throughout my teenage years, I was occasionally a referee for the youngest soccer leagues, a junior camp counselor at a boy scout day camp, a tutor, or a babysitter.\nWhat is important to you in finding a family? Mutual respect for every person in the relationship is extremely important to me. I also look for open, comfortable communication and safety as a priority.\nWhat is your availability? As I am employed full-time, my current availability is on a case-by-case basis for individual days.\nWhat was your childhood like? Busy! My parents supported and encouraged my younger siblings and I through an ever-expanding list of activities and interests, from music, swim, and gymnastics lessons to graciously thanking me for the 547th keychain I\u0026rsquo;d braided.\nCan you work in a home with pets? Absolutely! I have no pet allergies and love being around animals. If you have pets in your home I\u0026rsquo;ll of course have some questions for you - and I reserve the right to draw the line at snakes and spiders!\nDo you drive? I am a safe and cautious driver, and have a perfect driving record. It is preferred that a vehicle is provided by the family for use during work, though this is negotiable.\nAre you first aid trained? Yes! I keep my certification current, taking an in-person first aid/CPR class every two years. I have also had winderness first aid training.\nCan you cook?\nI like to think so! I\u0026rsquo;ll never claim to be a chef, but I have a growing collection of tried-and-true recipes that I use both at work and in my home life. I cook primarily \u0026ldquo;from scratch,\u0026rdquo; avoiding canned soups and frozen dinners. I love to involve children in the kitchen with age-appropriate tasks!\nCan you swim? I am a certified lifeguard, strong swimmer, and confident caring for children at both pool and beach settings.\nDo you have experience with children with special needs? For five summers during university, I worked as a classroom aide in a school for children with developmental disabilities. Particularly, I was placed in a classroom of non-ambulatory children, from ages three up to early teens. Most of these children were also non-verbal, and any activity we did required significant adaptation between the students to ensure they each gained something from the experience. As I was studying music therapy at the time, I also arranged with the school to provide occasional music experience sessions to other classrooms in the building. As a music therapy student, I worked under instruction of board certified music therapists to create and implement music sessions with different populations, including several groups of children with both developmental disabilities and behavioral disorders.\nHow else can you help my family? I am first and foremost a childcare provider. However, I can help out your family in other ways when I am not directly responsible for taking care of children - during naptime, or during school hours for older children.
