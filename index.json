[{"categories":null,"contents":"Once again, we started off camp by reading the story of the day. For The Snow Queen, I found a version already edited for children, and cut it down a bit further to make it a bit shorter and more concise. The kids enjoyed it! When we finished, I asked them if any parts of it sounded familiar. When they said no, I gave them a couple things to focus on: someone riding a reindeer to go rescue a character from an icy castle, and a character getting so frozen they turned blue, and were only warmed when their best friend gave them a hug and cried. It took a few minutes, but while I was getting supplies set out for our first activity, B7 suddenly shouted out, \u0026ldquo;Elsa!\u0026rdquo; He was really pleased with himself for puzzling it out.\nWe started out by melting the Snow Queen\u0026rsquo;s castle. I had mixed some baking soda witha bit of water - just enough to make it moldable - and pushed it into some small sandcastle molds. I froze them overnight, hoping at the very least to help them set, but also thought they might still be a tiny bit cold. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there was enough water in the mix for them to actually have frozen, but they still stayed in their castle shaped when I popped them out of the molds, so it was a success either way. I set them up in trays on the table. They were actually set up ready before we started the story at the beginning of camp, and I really enjoyed listening to the kids talk about what they thought it was made out of. They had settled on flour and salt, which I did not try to correct. I gave them a cup with a vinegar and water mixture along with some pipettes, and they had a bit of a shock when it started bubbling up! B7 made the connection to the reaction looking the same as what we had for potions class during Harry Potter camp. Even after they finished melting the castles, the girls were really enjoying pouring the watery mixture back and forth, and scooping up the baking soda that hadn\u0026rsquo;t dissolved - it has sort of a slimy texture which they enjoyed exploring.\nWe have found a youtube channel that we really like for drawing tutorials called the Art for Kids Hub. We discovered it during Dino Days, and really like the style of instruction, as well as seeing the kid\u0026rsquo;s drawing next to the grown-up\u0026rsquo;s! We used this resource again to learn to draw reindeer.\nThe previous day, I had put a squirt of paint in each cup of an ice cube tray, mixed it with water, stuck half a popsicle stick in for a handle, and stashed them in the freezer. I brought them out now, along wiht some big sheets of white paper, and they set to work exploring this new style of painting. It was fun to see their reactions to how the quality of the paint changed over time. B7 described it as being like a marker at first, where it would just scrape off the side of the ice block, but as time went on and the ice melted a bit, they started having fun mixing the colours and letting the watery parts run together.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Aug 15, 2020 at 6:37am PDT\n  Next, we make some snowflakes by folding up paper into wedges and cutting out shapes. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t practiced this one beforehand because I remembered it from my childhood, but I was a bit surprised at how difficult it was to do the cutting. G5 had to work really hard! I had also totally blanked on how to make it 6-pointed, but 4 pointed did the trick for today. B7 was loving testing out cut shapes and seeing how they looked when it all opened up. He help finding faces in the forms he made.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Aug 15, 2020 at 9:36pm PDT\n  Our final activitiy was making origami doves. Nice and simple! It was good that this camp day was pretty chill - in more ways than one! - because this happened to fall on the hottest day of our summer in California so far.

I asked the kids to try some magic words they knew. G2 tried \u0026ldquo;abracadabra\u0026rdquo; - no luck! B7 tried \u0026ldquo;alohamora\u0026rdquo; - still stuck. It seemed like maybe the phrase I was hoping to get in response was unfamiliar to them, so I told them that we would all try \u0026ldquo;open, sesame!\u0026rdquo; together, which did the trick!\nWe read my (heavily edited) verion of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves. I started with the original, which I got from Project Gutenberg, and read it through a few times to figure out exactly how much gruesome death and dismemberment was actually necessary for the story to make sense. You can read my version HERE, as long as you promise not to make fun of my ending!\nWhen we finished the story, we talked about different ways to weigh items. Thye immediately came up with the digital scale they see at every doctor\u0026rsquo;s check-up, and even recognised that we weigh fruits and vegetables when we buy them at the grocery store. For our first activity, we used a fulcrum scale made out of a clothes hanger to weigh, well, anything we could find lying around! I had some 1/4 oz lead chip weights from my model airplane flying days lying around, but just called them \u0026ldquo;units\u0026rdquo; so it didn\u0026rsquo;t get too complex.\nNext up, I gave them a treasure hunt to search for the hidden cave (aka, a box where I\u0026rsquo;d stashed the materials for the remaining activity). This was an enormous exercise in teamwork and patience for each of them! G2 and I eventually let G5 and B7 sort it out themselves and went back to the table to do some coloring, just checking in every once in a while to make sure they hadn\u0026rsquo;t gotten themselves turned around. After battling through the measurements for almost 45 minutes, they were so excited to find the treasure!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Aug 13, 2020 at 1:20pm PDT\n  The treasure they found was some brown model magic, which everyone was very excited to see! We talked about a couple different ways we could make jars - pinch pots or snakes - and got to work! I realized too late that I\u0026rsquo;d unthinkingly changes \u0026ldquo;jars\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;barrels\u0026rdquo; in my version of the story, so this activity didn\u0026rsquo;t tie in quite as well as I\u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo;ve liked it to, but I just stuck to \u0026ldquo;jars\u0026rdquo; from there on out.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Aug 13, 2020 at 7:36pm PDT\n  Unfortunately, we had to cut camp a bit short this day as there were other plans in the afternoon.

I found a version already edited for kids, and only wanted to change a few small details. For example, I added a paragraph that showed passage of time between when the miller\u0026rsquo;s daughter and the prince first met, and when they got married.\nOnce we finished the story - which was well-loved by all! - we got right to work on out thread artwork. I had each of the kids draw (or ask me to draw) a shape, and helped them hammer the nails at appropriate intervals. G5 only banged my fingers once! Then, they twisted the string around the nails until they were happy with the design it made. For G2, I held the string and had her point to which nail she wanted it wound around next.\nNext, we played one of my favourite word games: how many words can we make from the letters in \u0026ldquo;Rumplestiltskin\u0026rdquo;? I had pre-sorted some Bananagrams tiles with the right letters to give them a tactile way to shuffle them around.

I showed them how to get it going, and we ended up spending the rest of camp time, as well as a fair bit of time in the afternoon, focused on this craft. It was a challenging and even a little frustrating, but in a good way - these guys were DETERMIEND to get the hang of it.

First up was Brachiosaurus. I gave them each a bit of chalk, told them I was standing at the tip of the tail, and asked them to go mark where they thought the tip of it\u0026rsquo;s nose would be. Off they ran down the sidewalk - of course, Brachiosaurus being 100 feet long, they all underestimated rather severely! We had a 10-foot measuring tape, and B7 proved rather quick at the division needed to know how many times we needed to measure ten feet (for all the different dinos!). Once we measured it out, we drew a long line, and wrote the measurement at the end. Then, we returned to the starting point, and used the other side of the sidewalk to repeat our exercise with T-rex, Ankylosaurus, Dinonychus, and Triceratops. It was cool to see how many of them we had to line up tip-to-tail to even come close to reaching the same length as Brachiosaurus!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Aug 11, 2020 at 8:55pm PDT\n  When we returned to the backyard, we made a volcano eruption using hydrogen peroxide, dish soap, and yeast.

I threw them in the freezer, and while we were waiting for them, pulled out my last backup activity for the day. My mom had found some of those little grow capsules when she was cleaning out her stash of old art supplies and kids activities, and sent them to me in case I could use them. They were dinosaurs, so it fit perfectly this week!

They sent over an hour refining their designs! G5 and B7 had successful drops, and we all had a laugh when G2\u0026rsquo;s astronaut bounced right out of her spaceship and cracked - she\u0026rsquo;d forgotten to give it a roof. I will definitely be bringing this activity back again at some point, but with more restrictions on available materials.\nI usually let them be in charge of their own snacks. They collect the one or two items they\u0026rsquo;d like in the morning, and are able to eat it whenever they want throughout our camp time. Today, however, before we even left the house, I mentioned that we were going to learn a bit about how astronauts eat in space, and asked if they\u0026rsquo;d chosen their snacks wisely. I collected all their chosen snacks into a bag and said that just this once, we\u0026rsquo;d be eating together. While they were busy focusing on their egg drop experiment, I took a few moments to stick a bit of velcro on the backs of their snacks. I brought up a video of Chris Hadfield explaining the food situation on the ISS, and while they were watching, I rolled out a long strip of velcro on the table and stuck all their snacks to it. I also included a large-ish tupperware container for a trash can. Their challenge was to pretend they were in space while they were eating their snack - they\u0026rsquo;d have to make sure it was in their hand or velcroed to the table, otherwise it would float away! They looked a little skeptical, but started on their way. I was watching like a hawk for any slip-up, and soon enough, G2 set her wrapper down on the table, so I picked it up and started wandering away. She chased after me as soon as she noticed, and that\u0026rsquo;s when the fun really began! G5 and B7 had both chosen seaweed strips, which they had to make sure stayed in their container, and getting the lid off the trash can while keeping hold of their food and the wrapper was a challenge for everyone. G5 ended up becoming the designated runner as she would always be the first to notice anyone\u0026rsquo;s snack or wrapper drifting away and chase after it while laughing!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 6:23am PDT\n  Following snack time, we made our nebulas. I showed them some pictures - I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;ve seen any before, because they were in awe! We did some of what I call \u0026ldquo;Rorschach style\u0026rdquo; painting because it gets all blobby. We folded our papers in half, globbed a bit of paint on one side, then folded it over so it had a mirror image pattern. We smushed the paint around while it was folded over to give it more of a \u0026ldquo;cloudy\u0026rdquo; effect like nebulas. Once they were dry, I offered each of the kids a couple of my space stickers to add a planet, spaceship, or astronaut to their nebula - stickers are a huge hit around these parts and they\u0026rsquo;d never seen my space ones before, so that was exciting for them!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 26, 2020 at 7:50am PDT\n  Next, we made tiny rockets to launch off the ends of straws. It was a little finnicky for G5 and G2, but we got everyone going eventually! B7 even decided to just make his out of tape.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 26, 2020 at 12:43pm PDT\n  By this point it was lunchtime, bringing us to the end of space camp week! I told the kids it was all done, and they all got really quiet. B7 asked if I had one more activity planned that we hadn\u0026rsquo;t had time to do, and if they could please have a late lunch to squeeze in one more activity - which is how we ended up finishing off our week by making constellation viewers. I had the kids help me cover the ends with construction paper and tape, then I poked the holes. I made them the constellations I can always find the easiest, and only the most obvious stars from each to keep it simple for now. We ended up with the Big Dipper, Orion, Cassiopeia, and Cygnus.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 24, 2020 at 3:37pm PDT\n  ","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-5/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 5"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We started off Thursday by heading to a spot down the street that I was reasonably confident would stay sunny throughout the day. We traced our shadows around 10, 11, 12, and then later in the afternoon around 3 to watch how they moved and changed throughout the day! B7 had a previous understanding of this and was fantastic at explaining to his sisters what would happen and why, which was pretty cool. As we worked on this, we talked a bit about how sundials work to tell time.\nWhen we returned home, I asked to collect their chosen stuffed animals (I had asked them each to bring one to camp with them), and led them to a pile of all the recycling I\u0026rsquo;ve been hoarding for the last week or so: boxes, fruit clamshells, bottlecaps, TP tubes, I think there was even a sport drink tablet container in there! Their task: to create a spaceship for their animal astronaut. Their supplies: Any recycling they could find, plus a roll of masking tape apiece. I had brought along my boxcutter and told them that anywhere they wanted the cardboard cut, they could draw a line and I would cut it for them, but beyond that, they were on their own! I was amazed at their creativity. G2 wanted lots of circle-ish shaped cut out, which she glued together in a stack to make a \u0026ldquo;chair\u0026rdquo; for her astro-bunnies. G5 went with a basic rectangular prism box design, but spent a lot of time taping on lids and other small objects for buttons and drawing clocks and other gauges. B7 had a \u0026ldquo;go big or go home\u0026rdquo; attitude about it - he immediately started lining up boxes and cutting out the sides to make one long inside chamber, then took a page out of G5\u0026rsquo;s book to add in dials and buttons. I was so impressed by all three of them!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 23, 2020 at 1:36pm PDT\n  We watched a quick video on how astronauts exercise in space, and spoke for a few moments about why that is important. This led us to talking about long durations in space, which in turn was a perfect lead-up to start talking about Mars! I showed them some pictures taken by rovers of the martian landscape. Then, we got to work on a new art project: a Marsscape. To start with, I had them sketch out a horison line, and then paint in their sky. We had to let that part dry, and ended up returning to this activity later in the afternoon to finish up. We re-drew our horizons, then sketched out a few foreground details like rocks, small hills, and (my favourite part) tracks from the rover as though we were taking a picture of where we had been. Then, we used a paint brush to put glue only exactly where we wanted it, and started mixing up colored sand to create a whole range of hues across the red/orange part of the colour wheel! It was a blast!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 2:44pm PDT\n  Our last activity of the morning was a meteoroid toss. I had orginally planned on rolling out our distance scale solar system again, but it was too windy, so instead, we used a few boxed that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been turned into rocketships and labelled them with celestial bodies - the kids chose Jupiter for the biggest, Saturn for the medium-sized one, and Moon for the smallest. They had a bit of fun throwing our foil ball meteoroids around, and while we had a brief chat about the difference between meteor, meteoroid, and meteorite, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect those differences to stick!\n","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-4/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 4"},{"categories":null,"contents":"On Wednesday, we started out by painting our own planets! I\u0026rsquo;d picked up a large styrofoam ball for each of the kids, and we came back to this activity a few times throughout the day so they could let it dry between painting different sections, making it easier to hold. I was surprised that both of the older kids chose blue and green to make earth-like planets. We\u0026rsquo;d talked before we started about all the different ways that we could get lots of different colors just on earth (grey for rocks, yellow sand, red lava, white snow, and so on), but they were happy with their creations, so I can\u0026rsquo;t complain!\nNext, we pulled out or distance scale model of the solar system and played Saturn Ring Toss, using both a ring-style frisbee as well as a pool diving ring. B5 was the first to finally get his ring around Saturn, and moved on to aiming for Uranus while B5 worked on Saturn for a while longer.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 7:27pm PDT\n  We watched a video about how astronauts brush their teeth (B7 was so relieved to hear that the water sticks to the toothbrush - he had some concerns!), then I let the kids explore the Night Sky app on my phone for a few minutes while I got the supplies out for the next activity. They thought that was so cool - I\u0026rsquo;ll have to remember to take them out for some early evening star gazing in the winter when it starts getting dark before their bedtime!\nWe started our first constellation activity of the week by drawing with a white crayon on white paper - yep, you read that right! I told them to make dots all over the paper, and that these dots were going to be our stars. Then, we used watercolor paints to cover our paper, and the crayon dots showed through. In a stroke of luck, B7 had read a book the week before that had talked about wax resist painting on Ukranian easter eggs, so I brought that back up briefly to point out how it worked. The kids didn\u0026rsquo;t have as precise and defined \u0026ldquo;stars\u0026rdquo; as me, so after they finished painting their papers, we used mine to hunt for our own constellations (though G5 did find a seagull in hers!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 22, 2020 at 10:49pm PDT\n  Our final activity of Wednesday was a follow-along art video to learn to draw an astronaut. We have really enjoyed this style of art activity ever since the schools switched to distance learning due to COVID-19 and B7\u0026rsquo;s art teacher did his lessons in this style.\nOnce we finished, the kids begged to get the Oobleck back out. We had let it try up overnight, so I gave it to them with a pitcher of water so they could have control over the texture for themselves, which they really enjoyed. This came back out every day of the week (keeping our hands nice and blue!) They even asked to keep it at the end of the week, but I said we would make them one that didn\u0026rsquo;t have any dye inside to explore int he future.\n","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-3/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 3"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The first thing I had the kids do on Tuesday was make a design on some construction paper to set out for solar printing. Unfortunately, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work nearly as well as I\u0026rsquo;d hoped it would! By the end of the day, hardly anything showed up on our black paper. I had used a bit of red paper in my design, though, and that was completely bleached out - so I made that mental note for the future.\nWe finished up our ribbon rockets. It took us a few minutes to get the movement pattern in sync to slide them back and forth, but once they got going, we really enjoyed it!\nAfter this, I set them up with some Galaxy oobleck. I started with the cornstarch, and added the water a little bit at a time. THey started squishing it around and honestly, this is the biggest sensory hit I\u0026rsquo;ve had! They loved the soft texture of the cornstarch, and once we got it to a proper non-newtonian fluid, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep their hands out of it. I added some black, blue, and purple food coloring for them to swirl around as they played, as well as pearl cake decorations and glitter for stars.

We went to have a peek at our solar art, which was a disappointing couple of minutes. We decided to leave them there for another couple days to see if they made a better print, and then the kids went back to the oobleck for the rest of the morning. B7 chose instead to make his comet model (the other kids did them in spare time as the week continued), which I never grabbed a picture of - basically, we tied three different colors of ribbon around a stick to represent the three different parts of the tail (shorter ribbon for the coma, and longer ribbons for the gas and dust trails), then scrunched alfoil around the end for the nucleus of the comet. Not super impressive as an activity, but hopefully they\u0026rsquo;ll remember the general idea of the shape.\n","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-2/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"To kick off space camp, we all worked together to create our own colored versions of each planet. I had a little stack of flashcards with each planet on them (and some facts on the back), and we used those pictures to make our own, plus the sun and a few asteroids. I was really impressed at how hard these kiddos worked to recreate the images faithfully! So much attention to detail. My flashcards were copyright 2009, which means pluto was a bit of a blur. When G5 picked out that card, I pulled up some pictures from New Horizons to show the difference, and she used that as her example photo instead.\nNext, I stacked the planets in order and asked them to lay each out across the yard where they thought it belonged. I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell them they were in order (which is how we got Saturn next to Venus here), and it was pretty interesting to see how they chose to lay them out.

A neighbor down the road happened to have a telescope in his front yard for viewing NEOWISE, so we had a brief chat about that as well, and where the comet appeares in the sky.\nWhen we returned, we fixed up our model! I rolled out a long sheet of butcher paper, and we changed our step scale to a centimeter scale, glueing the planets and other celestial bodies down along the way.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 25, 2020 at 3:28pm PDT\n  After that, I showed them a video of Samantha Christiforetti demonstrating and giving a tour of the crew sleeping quarters on ISS. After the video, I asked them what other things they\u0026rsquo;d like to learn about how things work differently in space, and jotted down their answers to find videos for the remainder of the week.\nWe were very nearly out of time at this point! They took a few minutes to start turning TP tubes into rockets, but that\u0026rsquo;s now a project for Tuesday.\n","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/space-camp-day-1/","tags":null,"title":"Space Camp Day 1"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Thursday was Jungle day! We started off with a bit of an adventure through the jungle. I told the story of our jungle trek as we used yoga poses and other motions to demonstrate the animals and other sights we encountered. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I\u0026rsquo;ll plan again - the kids needed some prodding to get into it and weren\u0026rsquo;t overly enthused - but once they gave it a chance, you could see some glimmers of enjoyment that they were trying (unsuccessfully) to hide. I\u0026rsquo;d mostly done this for G2, as she is always making shapes with her body and asking what it looks like, or showing off her downward dog pose.\nNext up, I started showing them how to make pony bead lizards - is that a throwback to 1998 or what? B7 got the hang of it pretty quickly. It was a lot of focus on more advanced fine motor for G5; she did a few rows at a time and then I\u0026rsquo;d do 1 or 2 to get her going again. G2 made a lovely necklace (I gave her the lizard I made alongside them so she wasn\u0026rsquo;t left out of having one at the end).\nNext up was a sloth race. Whoever got to the finish last wins! The catch is that you always do need to be moving forward. It ended up not working very well to race next to each other, and instead, we used a timer and raced the clock and the leaderboard.\nWhile G2 was at her swimming lesson, the older two and I did another more focus-driven craft: origami jumping frogs. First, I showed them pictures of poison dart frogs, and they chose which sort of frog they wanted to make. We chose our colours of paper, folded the frogs, and then used markers to add the right markings and other colours.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 29, 2020 at 7:46am PDT\n  Would you believe that some rainforest animals came to visit our local park the night before our camp?

This was definitely a product-based art project, which isn\u0026rsquo;t very like me, but I though they had a bit of merit in the motor skills needed for their construction, and plus, turning them into marionettes gave the kids a type of toy they\u0026rsquo;d never explored before! We worked on them in stages throughout the day to make sure the paint and glue had sufficient time to dry. I also brought in my hot glue gun on Friday and we did giraffe surgery, making the marionette handle a bit sturdier and making sure googly eyes and limbs were all secure.\nNext, we went on a little safari. I would\u0026rsquo;ve loved to preset this one but since it was going to be spread out in a park with a bit of traffic, I decided to just ask my kiddos to give me a couple minutes to set it up when we got there. While they waited at the side of the field, I scattered the savanna animals around. Then, I gave each of them a paper where they could write down what they found on their safari, and how many. They had fun running around for a while looking for all the critters, and once they were finished exploring, we went and collected them all (bonus activity!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 28, 2020 at 9:10pm PDT\n  After spending a few minutes on the next steps of our giraffes, I set up an elephant \u0026ldquo;race,\u0026rdquo; minute-to-win-it style. I got the bowling pins out of their set, and had a pair of grey tights with a tenning ball in the foot for a trunk. We put the waist of the tights over our heads and used the trunk to knock down the pins.\nOur final activity of the day was \u0026ldquo;Mr. Hippopotamus.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;d found a write up of the yard game \u0026ldquo;Mr. Crocodile\u0026rdquo; online but honestly, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t like the chant. I changed the animal (I needed another syllable) and made it a call-and-response:\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Hippopotamus, can we cross the river?\u0026rdquo;\n(The Hippo answers yes or no - if \u0026ldquo;yes,\u0026rdquo; everyone can cross safely, and the game repeats.

We made play dough using 2 parts cornflour to 1 part hair conditioner, then I gave them some creative control over what food coloring drops to add to try and get it to turn brown. We all ended up with some variation on green, interestingly enough! Then I told them the more interesting part about wombat poop: that it is cube-shaped. We spent some time shaping our playdough into cubes. I let them know that there was one more interesting fact about wombats, but we\u0026rsquo;d come back to this activity at the end of camp, and I would tell them then.\nNext up was a little game with kangaroo pouches. I had some scrap \u0026ldquo;tshirt\u0026rdquo; type fabric that was long enough to tie around each kiddo\u0026rsquo;s belly to make a pouch. I scattered some of their stuffies around the yard, and asked them how many joeys they thought they could fit in their pouch, then we all hopped around while they tried to collect them all. It was only a quick game before it got too repetative, but pretty fun for those few minutes!\nNext, we sat down to do an art project. I showed them examples of the dot painting done by aboriginal people of Australia, and gave them stencils I\u0026rsquo;d made of some common Aussie animals to make their own. They ended up really getting into this one, which was pretty cool. B7 made two different ones that were more simple, and G5 really took her time filling up an entire paper on the snake design that she chose.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 28, 2020 at 7:28am PDT\n  Next up, we talked about flying foxes a bit. I could\u0026rsquo;ve fit bats in most of the days this week, but when I needed another movement activity for my Australian theme, I decided it could land here! I showed them some pictures of flying foxes so they could get a sense of how big they are, then we played an echolocation game. They were blindfolded, and bounced a ball against a wall. They then decided how close they were: they could choose to either take a step forward, or decide that they were close enough to the wall to touch it and remove the blindfold to check. Then, someone would bring the ball back to them, and they\u0026rsquo;d repeat until they were happy with their distance!\nFollowing our exploration of echolocation, we revisited the wombat poop, which had dried up a little. I shared my last wombat poop fun fact with them: wombats not only poop in cubes, but they also stack it up! We spent the rest of camp time stacking our wombat poop and seeing how high we could get our piles built.\nI\u0026rsquo;d had one more craft activity planned for the day, but as a pretty basic cut-and-paste \u0026ldquo;product art\u0026rdquo; activity I wasn\u0026rsquo;t chomping at the bit to include it.

On the way to work I stopped and picked up a small bag of ice from the supermarket. I dumped the ice into the water table, and set the ice blocks with animals on top. I supplied a few cups of water (and had a pitcher nearby for refills), pipettes, and a couple screwdrivers for my kiddos to use on their rescue mission. As they freed the animals, we identified them and they started to figure out what all they had in common, eventually coming up with the theme for the day: animals of the arctic.\nThe week\u0026rsquo;s theme was animals, but I could hardly visit the arctic without talking about the aurora borealis.

They came up with fur, fat, and shelter (I loved hearing shelter from G5 - I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even considered that as a possible answer!) Then, we tested out all different insulators (in the icy water table, now that it had melted a little more - no need to get more bowls, ice, or water!) I used produce bags to hold yarn (for \u0026ldquo;fur\u0026rdquo;), feathers, a little fabric sleeve I\u0026rsquo;d sewn (to mimic just being a person wearing a shirt), and finally, the Crisco. I had some rubber gloves for them to put on in case they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get their hand in the Crisco (B7 and G5 used the glove, G2 didn\u0026rsquo;t touch the Crisco at all). I made data collection pages for them to write which insulator they were testing, and how it felt to them. It was really cool to hear their descriptions and how they chose to take data. You can see how B7 wrote numbers in some rows - he\u0026rsquo;s saying that he could keep just his hand, as a control, in the water for 28 seconds, then said probably about 100 seconds for the yarn, and what looks to be approximately 1 trillion for the blubber - just \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 27, 2020 at 7:47am PDT\n  Next up was following along a how-to-draw video on youtube. We do this about once a week these days. It started during distance learning when B7\u0026rsquo;s art teacher was doing this style of art classes over Zoom, and both B7 and G5 really enjoy it! To fit our arctic theme, we drew narwhals.\nOur final activity of the day was charades. Since they were new to the game, and since the animals weren\u0026rsquo;t as familiar to them, I made a poster of choices that both the actor and the guessers could see. I left them unlabelled in my preparation, so the first thing we did was identify them, then we were off! The parents have told me that they\u0026rsquo;ve played a couple evenings as well.

They kept getting stuck in a certain place, but for a long time they weren\u0026rsquo;t at all willing to experiment. B7 finally solved the maze by - literally - army crawling the whole entire thing!\nAfter working a little more on our snitches, we made bleach-resist tshirts. I had cut out carboard shapes of a few popular symbols from the Harry Potter universe, and one by one, they chose where they wanted them to show up on their shirt. Then, I asked them to stand back, and sprayed bleach over the shirts. They were rather amazed by the color changing so quickly (and I was rather thankful - I\u0026rsquo;d tested it at home the night before and it hadn\u0026rsquo;t worked nearly as quickly or vividly as I\u0026rsquo;d hoped, so I was over the moon with how well it worked when it counted!)\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 18, 2020 at 9:08pm PDT\n  I needed a few minutes to rinse the shirts and throw them in the washer, so I set them up with a follow-along art video.

Today, we drew unicorns.\nFinally, we played \u0026ldquo;petrificus totalus\u0026rdquo; tag. You guessed it - freeze tag! We all said \u0026ldquo;petrificus totalus\u0026rdquo; when we were freezing someone, and \u0026ldquo;finite\u0026rdquo; when unfreezing our teammates. In hindsight, I should have done this earlier in the week before introducing the whomping willow game, as it was a bit lackluster without the extra rescue element.\nWhen we had some free time at the end, they asked to play more Whomping Willow, and then we did a few more building challenges with our troll bogies.\n","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/harry-potter-camp-day-4/","tags":null,"title":"Harry Potter Camp Day 4"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We started off the day with a challenge: could they make Harry\u0026rsquo;s glasses - and attach a scar - using pipe cleaners?\nOnce they were happy with their glasses, we headed to the park for a couple activities.\nFirst was Basilisk Bubbles.

Dip them in bubble solution, then blow through the mouth opening where you would normally drink, and a big foamy snake of bubbles comes out the other side. We experimented with adding food coloring to try to get them green, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have heaps of luck.

It was a little windy this day, so we made our race distances super short, and while they occasionally struggled to keep control of their balloon, it was still a lot of fun!\nHeading back home, we added another layer of paint to our snitches, then played The Whomping Willow. I had a little stuffed mouse named Scabbers sitting at one end of the yard. One player is the \u0026ldquo;Whomping Willow.\u0026rdquo; The remaining players must work together to rescue Scabbers and bring him safely to the other end of the yard. The Whomping Wilow (who can move) tries to tag all the other players, who then are frozen. They can be unfrozen by their teammates. If the team can get Scabbers to safety, they win, but if the Whomping Willow freezes everyone before Scabbers is rescued, then the Willow would win.\nThis day, we had a friend of B7 come to join us. During the free choice time at the end of the morning, he taught us how to draw a landscape of Hogwarts castle.

We got pretty far on those, just leaving the folding for another day once all the glue had dried.\nThere was a bit of free time at the end of the morning.

Instead, I kpet them indoors until everything was ready to go, and when I led them into the outdoor camp space, they found a little owl on the table with letters for each of them. I just re-wrote the Hogwarts letter from book 1 to suit my needs.\nNext, we chose our houses. I\u0026rsquo;d had a backup activity planned to prevent drama over who would be in which house, but luckily, they all happily chose different houses, so we were good to go with B7 as Hufflepuff, G5 as Gryffindor, and G2 as Slytherin. I showed them the jars and bead stash for house points, and let them start with 5 each. We came back to this throughout the week. They earned points for winning games, doing their best work on projects, or doing something unusually nice or thoughtful, and lost points for poor behaviour.\nUp next was making wands. I had collected suitable sticks and scattered them around a little grove of trees in the local park. I also made a bowtruckle out of pipe cleaners and some fake leaves I had lying around. I introduced them to Pickett and explained that bowtruckles only live in trees that feel magical, and he would help us be able to tell which sticks would be good wand-wood. (This gave me an easy out when G2 grabbed what was essentially a dried out 4-foot long bush - Pickett just said it wasn\u0026rsquo;t magical!) We walked to the local park and found our sticks. Pickett would let the kids know when they had something that was wand wood, and also (speaking through me) let them know that they could keep looking until they found one that felt \u0026ldquo;powerful.\u0026rdquo; (Idk, it seemed like a good idea to draw out the activity and make it so they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel forced to stick with the first thing they picked up.) Anyways, it worked pretty well, and we took the sticks back home to turn into wands. I gave them each a bit of clay to turn into a handle, and then let them choose their \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; - red feathers for phoenix feathers, white ribbon for unicorn hair, and red embroidery floss for dragon heartstring. We put those on the inside of the handles so they were completely contained.

I pre-made the supersaturated sugar solution (which I called \u0026ldquo;elixir,\u0026quot;) but had them roll the lollipop sticks in sugar and mix in the food coloring until they were happy with the shade.\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Bethany (@nannyblt) on Jul 15, 2020 at 11:16am PDT\n  Once our sorcerer\u0026rsquo;s stones were safely out of the way to grow, we made troll bogies. I used a no-cook playdough recipe (the usual cream of tartar recipe, but with a smaller amount of boiling water instead of cooking it on the stove) and let them choose which colours to mix in to create a lovely greenish yellow booger colour.

This opens up into a whole web of topics, each intertwined with the rest. Maintaining a positive environment is important so the child feels safe to explore, try new things, and make mistakes without repercussions aside from the natural consequence. To one child, this might mean climbing just a little bit higher on the jungle gym. I’ll be there to catch them, but it is up to the child to test their limits in balance and strength, and learn what happens when they exceed their abilities. To another child, this could look like them trying out what happens if they start shouting and making demands, rather than asking for help. I’ll be their example and practice partner for how they can best ask questions and negotiate for things they want. As I keep an eye on their development, I will see what accomplishment they are nearing, and set up the environment to make that more accessible.\nThere is no one specific childcare philosophy that I adhere to, but I am constantly looking for new material that supports my basic idea about interacting with the environment. While I am not trained in RIE, I can use the idea of a “yes space” to better design an area for a baby to explore without needing constant input from me - and eliminating the need for me to disallow certain actions. While I wouldn’t necessarily call play “work” like Montessori teachers do, I love to involve children in everyday tasks like preparing meals, wiping up spills, and putting dirty clothes in the appropriate place. As a self-described “artsy-crafty” person, I’m drawn to the idea of Waldorf education and bring movement and visual arts into many academic or cognitive based goals, but I still see a role for store-purchased toys.\nWhat seems to be the magic question these days: what are my views on screen time? If it is left 100% up to me, I only use screen time in very rare and special occasions. Sometimes, a surprise popcorn and movie night for school age kids can be timed perfectly to give them a relaxing night after a jam-packed week of school, homework, sports, and other activities. I tend to avoid it altogether for children preschool age and younger, though, unless it is already established in the family’s routine and the parents are happy the way things are. Otherwise, there’s just too many things to explore!\nHelping to raise respectful, curious, and independent children is why I do what I do.

Throughout my teenage years, I was occasionally a referee for the youngest soccer leagues, a junior camp counselor at a boy scout day camp, a tutor, or a babysitter.\nWhat is important to you in finding a family?

I cook primarily \u0026ldquo;from scratch,\u0026rdquo; avoiding canned soups and frozen dinners. I love to involve children in the kitchen with age-appropriate tasks!\nCan you swim? I am a certified lifeguard, strong swimmer, and confident caring for children at both pool and beach settings.\nDo you have experience with children with special needs? For five summers during university, I worked as a classroom aide in a school for children with developmental disabilities. Particularly, I was placed in a classroom of non-ambulatory children, from ages three up to early teens. Most of these children were also non-verbal, and any activity we did required significant adaptation between the students to ensure they each gained something from the experience. As I was studying music therapy at the time, I also arranged with the school to provide occasional music experience sessions to other classrooms in the building. As a music therapy student, I worked under instruction of board certified music therapists to create and implement music sessions with different populations, including several groups of children with both developmental disabilities and behavioral disorders.\nHow else can you help my family? I am first and foremost a childcare provider. However, I can help out your family in other ways when I am not directly responsible for taking care of children - during naptime, or during school hours for older children. I have great organizational skills, am willing to do a bit of light cleaning, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s child-related, and love to cook. If you are looking for more than straight childcare, we can absolutely talk about how I can best assist your family!\n","permalink":"http://www.nannyblt.com/faq/","tags":null,"title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In this space, you will find the components that make up most of the portfolio I have in-hand for interviews, including my resume, longer descriptions of my experience, letters of recommendation, and certificates.
