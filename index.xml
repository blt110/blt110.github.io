      <description>G3&amp;rsquo;s third theme request of the school year was snow. I had a lot of fun putting this one together, but I did find that it lent itself more to sensory exploration than numbers, alphabet, and so on, so it was harder to balance out the types of activities.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, we started out by painting our own planets! I&amp;rsquo;d picked up a large styrofoam ball for each of the kids, and we came back to this activity a few times throughout the day so they could let it dry between painting different sections, making it easier to hold.</description>

      <description>First up this day was making giraffes. This was definitely a product-based art project, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very like me, but I though they had a bit of merit in the motor skills needed for their construction, and plus, turning them into marionettes gave the kids a type of toy they&amp;rsquo;d never explored before!</description>
